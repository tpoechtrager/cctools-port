    VCVT<c><q>.F16.F32 <Dd>, <Qm> Encoded as op = 0 (aka fcvthps)
  Radar bug #8951023.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-798 release):
- Changed arm_disasm.c to use the arm assembly comment character '@' instead of
  the intel comment character ';' so the output of otool(1) can be assembled.

- Added support for LC_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT in ofile_print.c . Radar bug #8653976.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-796 release):
- Fixed the arm disassembly of vq{r}shr{u}n instructions.  The masks should have
  not included the 0x00300000 as those were part of the imm6 feild and not part
  of the opcode.  Radar bug# 8597212.
- Fixed the i386 (32-bit) disassembly of displacement to not have more than
  32-bits.  Radar bug #8454529.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-784 release):
- Changed the handling of printing the Objective-C section to deal with iOS
  simulator binaries being 32-bit intel and in the Objective-C 2 ABI.  The
  change was to have print_objc_segment() now return a bool if the binary does
  not have the __OBJC segment and is an I386 binrary.  Then the code in main()
  sets up and calls print_objc2_32bit().  Radar bug #7912209.
- Added print_version_min_command() to ofile_print.[ch] and support for
  printing the LC_FUNCTION_STARTS load command.  Radar bug #7902277.
- Fixed the disassembly of first operand of a movzw{l,q} in i386_disassemble()
  in i386_disasm.c for the case MOVZ by setting rex to 0 after calling
  get_reg_name() to get the second argument.  Radar bug #8017633.
- Fixed the disassembly of j*cxz instructions in i386_disassemble() in
  i386_disasm.c for the case BD to look at if the target is 64-bit and look for
  the Address-size override prefix byte to print the correct form of the
  mnemonic.  Also fixed the constants in displacement() in i386_disasm.c
  when sign extending a byte and a word to be unsigned long long values.
  Radar bug #8061602.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-783 release):
- Added the -llvm_mc option to disassemble so llvm-mc will assemble.
- Added printing the section types to support thread local variables,
  added printing the X86_64_RELOC_TLV and GENERIC_RELOC_TLV relocation types,
  and added printing the indirect table entries for sections of type
  S_THREAD_LOCAL_VARIABLE_POINTERS to ofile_print.c . Radar bug #7796734.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-782 release):
- Fixed a bug with disassembling crc32b in 64-bit when a register greater than
  8 is used.  In i386_disasm.c the array REG64_BYTE[] was extended to include
  the other 8 register names and the code that uses it had (REX_B(rex) << 3)
  or'ed into the index with the existing r_m bits.  
- Added support for disassembling the Intel aes instructions.  Radar bug
  #7709572.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-781 release):
- Added support for LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB to print_loadcmds(), print_libraries(),
  print_dylib_command() and print_hints() in ofile_print.c . Radar bug #7659206.
- Fixed a problem with 64-bit disassembly of call instructions getting the
  incorrect target.  Radar bug #7615109.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-777 release):
- Removed -fno-builtin-round from the Makefile.  Radar bug #7475139.
- Changed the Makefile to use -Os for OFLAG.  Radar bug #7475093.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-775 release):
- Added the print_immediate_func() to arm_disasm.c to print out the movw and
  movt instruction immediates with the new arm HALF relocation entries.
  Updated print_relocs() in ofile_print.c to print out the new arm HALF 
  relocation entries.  Radar bug #7421496.
- Fixed a bug in the print_address_func() in arm_disasm.c where it needed the
  pc also passed to it be able to match that up with the r_address of a
  relocation entry.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-774 release):
- Fixed the intel disassembly in i386_disasm.c so that make a386_test and make
  ax86_64_test targets in the cctools as directory will work.  Radar bug 7414888
- Added the disassembly of the invvpid and invept instructions to
  i386_disasm.c .  Radar bug #7383743.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-772 release):

  and second register operands switched.  Radar bug 7308888.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-764 release):
- Changed the license on all otool source files.  Radar bug #6538662.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-763 release):
- Added the disassembly for the rrx instructions to arm_disasm.c .  Radar bug
  #7098328.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-762 release):
- Changed the Makefile to set CC when when SDKROOT is set.  Radar bug #7078805.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-760 release):
- Fixed a problem with the leading address for raw text bytes of x86_64 not
  being printed as a 64-bit hex value.  The fix was in print_text() in main.c .
  Radar bug #7012357,

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-759 release):
- Added the disassembly for the pldw, vcvt.f32.f16, vcvt.f16.f32, vcvtt and
  vcvtb instructions to arm_disasm.c .  Radar bug #6959129.
- Added printing the memory barrior options ish, ishst, osh and oshst and
  changed un to nsh and unst to nshst in arm_disasm.c . Radar bug #6982242.
- Changed the Makefile to add -isysroot $(SDKROOT) to compile and link lines
  when SDKROOT is set.  Radar bug #6965029.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-757 release):
- Fixed a problem with 64-bit call (near) instructions not showing 64-bit
  register names.  This is a special case where in a 64-bit object the
  FF /2 opcode results in a 64-bit operand even without a rex prefix byte.
  So added logic for this in the case of indirect to memory or register operand
  to set the REX.W bit to indicate 64-bit operand size.  Radar bug #6907058.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-755 release):
- Fixed a problem with 64-bit intel binaries not having their addresses correct
  for call targets when some of the high 32-bits are set.  Changed the type of
  the parameter value of displacement() in i386_disasm.c from uint32_t to
  uint64_t.  And change the two uses to use the variable imm0 instead of value0
  in i386_disassemble() in i386_disasm.c . Radar bug #6740004.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-754 release):
- Changed the Objective C data printers to account for the LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO
  load command causing some of the sections to be encrypted.  Code and fields
  were added to print_objc.c, print_objc2_32bit.c and print_objc2_64bit.c to
  set the protected field of the sections structure based on the range of the
  LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO load command if present.  Radar bug #6784286.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-753 release):
- Change the #ifdef around the print_x86_thread_state32 lable in ofile_print.c
  to removed a warning when compiled on Tiger.

    in i386_disasm.c.
- Fixed typos in the usage line for "symbolically".  Radar bug #6700325.
- Changed the printing of the uuid in print_uuid_command in ofile_print.c so it
  matches how dwarfdump(1) prints it.  Radar bug #6723850.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-751 release):
- Changed the printing of Objective-C data so that strings from protected
  sections are printed as "some string from a protected section" instead of
  what looks like junk when the protected string is printed as characters.
  Radar bug #5578032.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-750 release):
- Changed so that armv7 defaults to printing in thumb mode.  Moved in_thumb
  boolean to a global in arm_disasm.[ch] and set it to TRUE in main.c if the
  binary is armv7.  Radar bug 6651124.
- Fixed a problem with print_objc_segment() in print_objc.c that was incorrectly
  using sizeof(void *) when it should have been using sizeof(uint32_t).
  Radar bug #6652270.
- Updated ofile_print.c for the places it was missing code for
  S_16BYTE_LITERALS.  Radar bug #5947957.
- Fixed the x86_64 disassembly of with and SIB byte when mode is 0 and base is 5
  and ss is not zero so that it does not print a base register.  Radar bug
  #6533811

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-749 release):
- Fixed the printing of Objective-C meta data from 64-bit object files.  So that
  every "dereference" of a pointer looks for a relocation entry.  Also added
  the -V option to print the symbol names from the relocation entries.
  Radar bug #6549235.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-737 release):
- Changed arm_r_types[] for entry 7 to T_BR32 in ofile_print.c for the new
  ARM_THUMB_32BIT_BRANCH relocation type.  Radar bug #6511482.
- In print_insn() in arm_disasm.c removed the code at the end to check for
  status of running into the end of the section's memory and returning a -1
  for the size of bytes it disassembled (as that caused it to loop).  Radar
  bug #6504790.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-733 release):
- In arm_dis.c, updated thumb ldmia instruction to handle the case where Rn is
  in the register list and thus shouldn't be updated. Radar bug #6394340.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-725 release):
- Changed print_library_toc() in ofile_print.c to set toc_byte_sex to the
  host_byte_sex if it is passed as UNKNOWN_BYTE_SEX as a better guess.
  Radar bug #6303685.
- Added support for new compressed LINKEDIT information. Radar bug #6232822.
  - Changed otool -lv to print out dyld_info command in ofile_print.[ch] .

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-724 release):
- Updated print_mach_header() in ofile_print.c to print the MH_KEXT_BUNDLE
  file type and the MH_DEAD_STRIPPABLE_DYLIB flag.  Radar bug #6272534.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-722 release):
- Changed print_ivar_list_t() in both print_objc2_32bit.c and
  print_objc2_64bit.c to print the pointer value for ivar offsets in hex and
  dereference that pointer and print the real offset as well.  Radar bug
  #5733291.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-715 release):
- Fixed problems with the printing of the Objective-C meta data in print_objc.c
  where if an object file has a non-zero sized section from the __OBJC segment
  at address zero it will think NULL pointer feilds point to valid data.
  The fixes were to the get_* routines to check the addr parameter to see it it
  has the value of zero and if so return FALSE.  Also a few checks for lists
  like ivars being past the end of a section needed a break not a continue to
  terminate the loop.  Radar bug #6164922.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-714 release):
- Added the missing stuff for arm in print_arch() and print_cputype() in
  ofile_print.c. Radar bug #6155212.

  print_objc_segment() in print_objc.c when trying to print the Category
  Definition count where it was using sizeof(void *) which should have been
  sizeof(uint32_t).  Radar bug #6107717.
- Fixed another integer overflow problems in print_reloc() in ofile_print.c
  Radar bug #5796857.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-708 release):

  Radar bug #5739542.
  - Moved print_objc2.c to print_objc2_64bit.c and changed print_objc2() to
    print_objc2_64bit()
  - Copied print_objc2_64bit.c to print_objc2_32bit.c and changed every where
    a 64-bit, pointer, name or value was used to used a 32-bit version.
  - In print_objc2_32bit.c removed the reserved field from the class_ro_t
    as it is a 64-bit only padding field.
- Made a change in print_indirect_symbols() in ofile_print.c so it does not get
  spurious error about a load command extending past the end of the load
  commands.  Radar bug #5728302.
- Made a change in print_indirect_symbols() in ofile_print.c to print ABSOLUTE
  for cputype CPU_TYPE_I386 and S_SYMBOL_STUBS sections marked with just
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS.  Radar bug #5829053.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-691 release):
- Added support for the LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO load command.  Radar bug #5811994.
  - Added print_encryption_info_command() in ofile_print.[ch] .
  - Added code in print_loadcmds() in ofile_print.c for LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-690 release):
- Changed the Makefile to added -DEFI_SUPPORT if EFITOOLS is not via the top
  level Makefile.  And #ifdef'ed EFI_SUPPORT the call to
  print_coff_reloc_section() in main.c .Radar bug #5826370.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-688 release):
- Maded changes for the new LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB load command. Radar bug #5760930.
  - Added an test for the S_LAZY_DYLIB_SYMBOL_POINTERS section type in

  - In ofile_print.c these changes were made:
    - print_loadcmds() had a case for LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB added.
    - print_loadcmds() had a case for LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB added and a test of
      LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB to print the string "LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB".
    - print_section() had a test for S_LAZY_DYLIB_SYMBOL_POINTERS to print that
      as a string and a test for printing "(index into indirect symbol table)"
      after the reserved1 field.
    - print_dylib_command() had a test for LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB to print that as
      a string.
    - print_indirect_symbols() had a test for the S_NON_LAZY_SYMBOL_POINTERS
      section type added.
    - print_hints() had a case for LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB added.

- Changed the Makefile to use OBJC_ABI for -fobjc-abi-version=1 since this is
  not supported on Tiger.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-682 release):
- Added -fobjc-abi-version=1 to the Makefile rule for building print_objc.o
  Since we're trying to get the objective-C 1.0 definitions and not the 2.0
  definitions, this avoids problems with platforms where 2.0 is the default.
  Radar bug #5725807.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-681 release):
- Removed all __OPEN_SOURCE__ references in Makefile, notes, arm_disasm.c,
  main.c, ofile_print.c and otool.h .
- Fixed a bug in disassembly for the i386 SSE4.1 instruction insertps
  where it had the second parameter as a general register not a xmm register.
  The change was in i386_disam.c in the table entry for insertps to use
  SSE4i not SSE4ifm.  Radar bug #5650346.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-677 release):
- Changed the Makefile to not use -Wno-long-double and -no-cpp-precomp .
  Radar bug #5563553.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-676 release):
- Added printing S_DTRACE_DOF section type to print_section() in ofile_print.c.
- Fixed a problem with not all the i386 bad opcode bytes being printed.  The
  fix was at the end of i386_disassemble() in i386_disasm.c for printing the
  bad opcode byte to loop through all the length bytes it tried to disassemble
  before it ran into the bad opcode.  Radar bug #4760658.
- Fixed a problem with warning message being printed for zero length sections
  appearing at the end of object files that should have not been printed.  The
  test in get_sect_info() in main.c was testing for >= and not > against the
  object size.  Radar bug #4455994.
- Fixed the problems with x86_64 disassembly in printing the displacements or
  their target symbols.  The problem was the code in displacement() in
  i386_disasm.c did not take into account that instructions with and without
  relocation entries are assembled differently than all other Mach-O files.
  For x86_64 if it has a relocation entry the then displacement is an offset
  even if the symbol is defined.  If not the displacement plus the pc is the
  target address.  As part of the fix for this the addr and sect_addr needed
  to be passed as 64-bit value to i386_disassemble() and displacement().  Then
  the fix in displacement() was to construct a 64-bit target guess_addr if there
  was no relocation entry found for the x86_64 case.  Radar bug #5122861.
- Added support to print the PECOFF base relocation table. Radar bug #5218665.
  - The new routine print_coff_reloc_section() was added to the files
    coff_print.[ch].
  - Added code in main.c to test for the (__RELOC,__reloc) section being
    passed as the -s arguments and call print_coff_reloc_section().
  - The routine get_sect_info() was made extern in main.c and added to
    ofile_print.h so it could be called by print_coff_reloc_section().
- Fixed a bug in print_label() where the addr argument was a unsigned long not
  a uint64_t.  Changes in ofile_print.[ch] and print_objc.c. Radar bug #5186450.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-675 release):
- Changed print_indirect_symbols() so it would not crash if given a malformed
  object file that had a segment command with a very large number of sections.
  The fix was to add some size checking calculating the expected size in a
  64 bit value compare that to see if it too large.  Radar bug #5405675.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-673 release):
- Changed the sources so the arm stuff is not in the open source version.
  Radar bug #5326431.
  - Changed the Makefile to #ifndef __OPEN_SOURCE__ out the arm files
  - Added #ifndef __OPEN_SOURCE__ to the following files to bracket arm code:
    main.c, ofile_print.c, otool.h and arm_disasm.c .

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-665 release):
- Added the SSE4 instructions to the i386 disassembler.  The changes are in
  i386_disasm.c . Radar bug #4943015.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-659 release):
- Fixed a bug in the i386 disassembler to correctly assume 64-bit immediates
  for 64-bit object files with the MOV accumulator from memory operand (the to
  memory operand was already fixed in cctools-646 for this radar).
  The fix was for the OA case in i386_disassemble() in i386_disasm.c to
  test if it was a 64-bit object and pass the last argument to OPSIZE as 1 in
  that case.  Also changed for both the OA and AO case was to change the 
  mnemonic to "movabsl".  Radar bug 4693534.
- Changed print_objc2() in print_objc2.c to handle the move all metadata for
  objc-abi-version=2 out of segments __OBJC and __OBJC into the __DATA segment.
  The section mappings that applied were as follows:
    __DATA,__objc_classlist  was __OBJC2,__class_list
    __DATA,__objc_catlist  was __OBJC2,__category_list
    __DATA,__objc_protolist  was __OBJC2,__protocol_list
    __DATA,__objc_msgrefs  was __OBJC2,__message_refs
    __DATA,__objc_classrefs  was __OBJC2,__class_refs
    __DATA,__objc_superrefs  was __OBJC2,__super_refs
    __DATA,__objc_imageinfo  was __OBJC,__image_info
  otool -ov for LP64 examines the sections named above, and looks for both names
  (to avoid compiler revision lock).  Radar bug #5066149.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-656 release):
- Updated ofile_print.c to print the MH_PIE and MH_NO_REEXPORTED_DYLIBS flags.

  bug #4986624.
- Added printing the (__OBJC,__image_info) section info for 32-bit Mach-O files.
  Radar bug #4983418.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-649 release):
- Added support for printing the objc 2.0 metadata in 64-bit Mach-O files.
  Radar bug #4560930. 

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-648 release):
- Added the print_init_term_pointer_section() routine to ofile_print.[ch] and
  code to call in process() in main.c.  This is called when the section
  specified with -s is a of the type S_MOD_{INIT,TERM}_FUNC_POINTERS. Radar bug
  #4880624.
- Changed the check in get_symbol_table_info() in main.c to for the size of
  the symbol table extending past the end of the file so the check does not
  overflow and later cause problems.   Also changed the check in get_toc_info()
  get_indirect_symbol_table_info(), get_module_table_info(), get_ref_info() and
  get_hints_table_info in main.c so it does not have the same problems.
  Radar bug #4868234.
- Changed the check in print_fat_headers() in ofile_print.c for the nfat_arch
  being too large so the check does not overflow and later cause a crash.
  Then changed the loop printing the fat_arch structs to break out if it gets
  past the size of the file.  Radar bug #4860769.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-646 release):
- Fixed a bug in the i386 disassembler to correctly assume 64-bit immediates
  for 64-bit object files with the MOV accumulator to memory operand.
  The fix was for the AO case in i386_disassemble() in i386_disasm.c to
  test if it was a 64-bit object and pass the last argument to OPSIZE as 1 in
  that case.  Radar bug 4693534.
- Fixed a bug in the i386 disassembler to print the prefix rep not repz with the
  ins, outs, movs, lods, and stos instructions.  The change was to check the
  delayed prefix being printed to see if it was repz and the opcode was for
  one of the instruction then print rep instead.  The change was in in
  i386_disassemble() in i386_disasm.c . Radar bug #4467453.
- Fixed a bug in the i386 disassembler for opcodes with an SIB byte and with
  mod = 0 which means disp32 with no base.  Also changed the 32-bit disassembly
  to not print the scale if ss = 0.  These changes were in get_operand() in
  i386_disasm.c .  Also changed print_text() in main.c to print the raw bytes
  for CPU_TYPE_X86_64 objects as bytes not 32-bit values.  Radar bug #4523901.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-645 release):
- Added code in print_loadcmds() in ofile_print.[ch] to parse and print

      m88k_disasm.h
    and changed the uses of structs, constants and names that are different for
    64-bit files to the typedefs in "stuff/target_arch.h".
  - In all places that used sorted_symbols this was changed to the new type
    in "stuff/symbol.h" to struct symbol.  Which contains a name and an nlist_t.
  - Changed the places in main.c and ofile_print.c with #ifdef DINTERIM_PPC64

- Fixed a bug in print_fat_headers() in ofile_print.c in the loop that was
  looking for illegal duplicate architectures.  The loop was using unsigned
  indexes and testing for j < i - 1 without checkin that i could be zero.
  Radar bug #3709358.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-522 release):
- Fixed the problem with the changes to libc in Radar bug #3535291 causing the
  symbols ___fegetfltrounds and ___fpclassifyd to be undefined.
  Changed the Makefile to cause -lm_static to be used for releases after
  Panther.  And changed main.c to remove the ifdef's around the stubs
  __fpclassifyd() and __fpclassify(). Radar bug #3685865.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-520 release):
- Fixed a bug in the disassembly of the i386 movdq2q instruction.  Radar bug
  #3488840.
- Fixed a bug in the disassembly of the i386 move word to accumulator
  instructions.  It was incorrectly using the data-size attribute to determines
  the size of the offset.  For move to accumulator instructions the
  address-size attribute of the instruction determines the size of the offset.
  Radar bug #3515794.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-509 release):
- Added #ifdef INTERIM_PPC64 to the source changes to support the interim ppc64
  file format.  And added -DINTERIM_PPC64 to the Makefile.

  and #3562232.
  - Changed print_text() in main.c to treat CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64 the same as
    CPU_TYPE_POWERPC and CPU_TYPE_VEO.
  - Changed print_relocs() in ofile_print.c to print "quad" for an
    r_length == 3 and cputype == CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64 and r_type ==
    PPC_RELOC_VANILLA in 2 places.
  - Changed print_indirect_symbols() and guess_indirect_symbol() in
    ofile_print.c to set the stride to 8 for CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64 otherwise 4.
  - Updated print_arch(), print_cputype(), print_mach_header(), print_relocs()
    and print_r_type() in ofile_print.c for CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64 to be the same

Changes for the 5.14 release (the cctools-498 release):
- Added code to disassemble the PowerPC pseudo-instruction 'jmp' as the
 non-linking form of 'jbsr' in ppc_disasm.c .  Radar bug #3458928.

- Added stub functions for the notify API in the new file notify.c and picked
  up notify.h to allow otool to build on Panther7B40.  Radar bug #3378781.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-477 release):
- Added stub functions for __fpclassifyd(), for ppc, and __fpclassify() for i386
  to the end of main.c to allow otool to link with just libc.a given the new
  code in __ldtoa().  Radar bug #3271830.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-476 release):
- Fixed a bug in the i386 disassembly of movd instructions with the 0x7e sub
  opcode.  Radar bug #3268255.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-472 release):

  for register to memory and memory to register were switch.
  Radar bug #3250086.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-468 release):
- Added support for the new use of the previously unused value 3 for r_length
  to mean that the conditional branch was predicted using the Y-bit and the
  sign of the displacement and opcode.  Radar bug #3223045.
  - Changed in print_r_type() in ofile_print.c to take a new boolean parameter
    predicted to tell it to print "+/-" after the r_type.
  - Changed print_relocs() in ofile_print.c to set a local boolean predicted
    to TRUE when r_length is 3 and pass it to print_r_type().
  - Added the new routine get_reloc_r_length() to ppc_disasm.c .
  - Changed the routine get_reloc() to get_reloc_r_type() in ppc_disasm.c .
  - Change bc() in ppc_disasm.c to take 3 new parameters sect_offset, relocs and
    nrelos so it can look for a relocation entry with a r_length value of 3 to
    know to always print the prediction in this case.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-467 release):
- Added support for the PPC_RELOC_LO14_SECTDIFF relocation type used with
  double word load/store instructions. Radar bug #3218027.
  - Changed print_relocs() and in ofile_print.c to expect and print a pair
    relocation entry for PPC_RELOC_LO14_SECTDIFF relocation type.
  - Changed the 14th entry in ppc_r_types[] from " 14 (?) " to "LO14DIF " in
    ofile_print.c that print_r_type() uses.
  - Changed print_immediate() in ppc_disasm.c to handle PPC_RELOC_LO14_SECTDIFF.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-466 release):
- Fixed the incorrect cast on the comparison of the nlist struct's n_strx field
  where the value being compared to was casted to a long.  The correct fix was
  to cast n_strx to an unsigned long.  This is because the test is:

	if(something.n_un.n_strx >= string_size)
	    error(...)

  And the incorrect cast like this:

	if(something.n_un.n_strx >= (long)string_size)
	    error(...)

  will not catch the case when n_strx is negative.  So the correct cast is:

	if((unsigned long)something.n_un.n_strx >= string_size)
	    error(...)

  which was made in print_indirect_symbols() in ofile_print.c and a number of
  other places.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-465 release):
- Fixed the disassembly of "movd -12(%ebp),%mm0" which incorrectly disassembled
  without the displacement.  Radar bug #3206331.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-464 release):
- Made changes to build cleanly with gcc3.3
  - Removed -Wno-precomp from the Makefile
  - Fixed warnings for "comparison between signed and unsigned" in main.c,
    ofile_print.c, m68k_disasm.c, i860_disasm.c, m88k_disasm.c, i386_disasm.c,
    ppc_disasm.c, hppa_disasm.c, sparc_disasm.c, and print_objc.c .

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-463 release):
- Added support for the MH_DYLIB_STUB filetype. Radar bug #3193744.
  - Changed processor() in main.c when printing the section contents from
    an MH_DYLIB_STUB that has indirect symbol table entries to force the section
    size to zero and not try to print the contents that were stripped.
  - Added the printing of the MH_DYLIB_STUB filetype to print_mach_header() in
    ofile_print.c .

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-450 release):
- Fixed the disassembly of movd instructions that used GPR registers so things
  like:
        movd %edx, %xmm0
        movd %xmm0, %edx
  disassembled correctly.  Radar bug #3117176.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-454 release):
- Fixed a bug in disassembling a bad i386 instruction that had a value for a
  segment register greater than 6.  The array SEGREG[] was changed to add two
  more entries to cover all 8 possible values with the last two values being
  "%?6" and "%?7" for the illegal values.  Radar bug #3144846.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-439 release):
- Made the needed changes to main.c and ofile_print.c for VEO support.  Radar
  bug #3068161.
- Added the disassembly of the SSE2 instructions.  Radar bug #2972491.
- Changed the disassembly of i386 opcode "fildl" and "fistpl" to not use the
  'l' suffix because of the added i386 opcode "fildll" to be the same as "fildq"
  and "fistpll" to be the same as "fistpq" (done for Radar bug #2909568).

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-437 release):
- Fixed the disassembly of jbsr ppc instruction's (those with JBSR relocation
  entries) so the "true target address" is correctly printed.  This fix is in
  print_immediate() in ppc_disasm.c where the value should just be other_half
  not "other_half + value".  Radar bug #3046962.
- Fixed the printing of the pair JBSR relocation when it is a scattered
  relocation to point at the r_value as the other half "<- other_half".  This
  fix is in print_relocs() in ofile_print.c.  Radar bug #3046962.

- Added printing S_ATTR_WEAK_DEFS to print_section() in ofile_print.c.
  Radar bug #2898558.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-409.1 release):
- Changed print_literal8() in ofile_print.c to use:
	/* l0 is the high word, so this is equivalent to if(isfinite(d)) */
	if((l0 & 0x7ff00000) != 0x7ff00000)
  instead of:
	if(finite(d))
  so otool will not have to link with libm.  The Makefile was also changed.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-403 release):
- Removed the hack in the Makefile to use cc when $(CC) is gcc3 when linking
  to work that was working around Radar bug #2814731 now that gcc-1009 fixes it.

  and ppc_disasm.c to pick up the prototype for memcpy().

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-393 release):
- Added code to ofile_print.c to deal with the new LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB command.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-392 release):

- Changed the printing of sections marked with S_ATTR_SOME_INSTRUCTIONS so that
  they are disassembled.  This is to aid coalesced sections created by the
  compiler that are not marked with S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS as they contain
  jump tables (Radar bug #2580311).

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-342 release):
- Added a print_sub_client_command() to ofile_print.c . Radar bug #2533649.
- Added printing MH_TWOLEVEL and MH_FORCE_FLAT to print_mach_header() in
  ofile_print.c. Radar bug #2534043.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-341 release):
- Changed print_immediate() in ppc_disasm.c to also check for PPC_RELOC_SECTDIFF
  as it is incorrectly printing out "Stray PPC_RELOC_PAIR relocation entry".
  This is happening because switch tables for (__TEXT,__coalesced_text) sections
  are placed in line.  This is done because ld(1) complains about illegal
  references to coalesced symbols being used with section difference relocation
  entries.

Changes the 5.5 release (the cctools-307 release):
- Fixed some bugs in print_relocs() in ofile_print.c for ppc section difference
  relocations.  It was incorrectly printing "half = 0x????\n" some times which
  lead to an extra "\n" and difficulty in determining which relocation entry an
  error message was refering to due to the extra lines in the output.
- Added support for the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_7400 in ofile_print.c .
  Radar bug #2397523.
- Fixed a bug in get_sect_info() where it was not comparing the segment name

  segments with the same section names.

Changes the 5.4 release (the cctools-300 release):
- Added printing the new LC_ROUTINES load command.
- Added the S_COALESCED section type in section structures.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-292 release):

  "warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'".  This was done
  to m68k_disasm.c, i860_disasm.c and sparc_disasm.c .
- Changed the return type of main() in main.c from void to int to remove a
  warning from the egcs compiler.  Also changed the exit()'s calls at the end to
  return()'s.

Changes for the 5.3 release, (the cctools-286 release):
- Added support for printing S_MOD_TERM_FUNC_POINTERS in print_section() in
  ofile_print.c .

Changes for the 5.3 release, (the cctools-285 release):
- Fixed the i386 opcode of cmpxchg from 0x0fa6 (as it is in the i486 manual) to
  0x0fb0 which is correct (as it is in the Pentium manual).

Changes for the 5.3 release, MacOS X bring up (the cctools-282 release):
- Changed the printing of the ppc_thread_state to not use bit fields for srr1,
  cr and exr to match the ppc_thread_state for Rhapsody/MacOS X.
- Changed the Makefile to allow for RC_OS=macos for MacOS X builds.
- Added a few casts in places to get it to compile with the MetroWerks compiler
  without -relax_pointers.
- To get around the problem with the MetroWerks compiler using -framework
  System when -static is used the Makefile was changed to if out the -static
  flag and -static link for mwcc.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-274 release):
- Removed the uses of CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX in ofile_print.c and added support for
  new intel subtypes. Radar bug #2231830.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-272 release):
- Removed the reference to the header file "objc/NXString.h" in print_objc.c as
  this file is going away.  print_objc.c now just defines the layout of struct
  objc_string_object directly.  Radar bug #2231010.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-267 release):
- Added all the suport needed for the 4.4BSD extended format #1 for long names.
  Radar bug #1670513.

- Changed otool's use of CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_740 to CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_750.
- Fixed a bug that in processor() in main.c where indirect_symbols and
  nindirect_symbols were not initialized.  This caused printing of symbol
  stub sections to to call guess_indirect_symbol() with bad results (print
  incorrect stuff or crash).
- Fixed a bug in the ppc disasembler where it was printing the prediction of
  branch conditionals which had the BO 1z1zz (20 decimal) encoding.  See page
  4-53 of the PowerPC green book.

  bug #55627).  In here the changes were in ofile_print.c .
- Added -T, -M, -R and -I to the usage print out.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-156 release):
- Fixed a that caused sections with S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS set not to be
  disassembled.  This was casued by S_ATTR_SOME_INSTRUCTIONS also being set and
  the code in main.c checking the SECTION_ATTRIBUTES equal to 
  S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS and not just checking for that bit.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-158 release):
- Fixed a bug that caused printing of shlib and dyld names to be wrong.  Basicly
  the part of the structure that needed to be swapped was copied but the
  original pointer needed to be passed to the routine to print the name part of
  the structure.  This was introduced with the change for cctools-150 below.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-154 release):
- Added support for printing indirect symbol table entries for stripped defined
  externals.  Strip uses the values INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL and
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS to represent the symbols that are defined that were
  stripped otool prints these as LOCAL and ABSOLUTE.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-150 release):
- Fixed a bug in printing load commands that caused the thread commands on
  hppa to be printed swapped.  This was the same bug as the otool -L bug
  below where the wrong size to memcpy was used to copy the load command.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-149 release):
- Added printing the section attribute SOME_INSTRUCTIONS.
- Removed printing the section attribute RELOC_AT_LAUNCH.
- Added printing the mach header flag BINDATLOAD.
- Fixed a bug in print_libraries for otool -L with dynamic libraries that
  memcpy'ed the wrong size into the dylib_command (bug #50440).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-148 release):
- Changed how otool gets built.  It how gets built with -static.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-140 release):
- Picked up sparc changes to sparc_disasm.c.
- Added printing MH_BUNDLE filetype.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-138 release):
- Picked up a change to sparc_disass.c.  It was getting the targets for
  branches with negative displacements wrong.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-135 release):
- Fixed a bug in otool for sparc disassembly in the routine print_symbolic()
  which printed the wrong value for branch instructions when relocation entries
  were not present.  The problem was it was adding in the pc to the target
  value which already had the pc added to it.
- Fix for Tracker 41317 [as(hppa) : does not support cache control hints.]
  otool/hppa-dissasm.c changed to disassemble the new parsing rule changes.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-133 release):
- Picked up the sparc changes to sparc_disasm.c.
- Picked up the sparc changes for printing the floating-point sparc thread.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-132 release):
- Picked up the sparc changes for sparc_disasm.c and m88k_disasm.c.
- Picked up the sparc changes for printing the sparc thread.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-128 release):
- Fixed otool -c for the hppa.  Had to add special code in print_argstrings()
  in main.c to deal with the different stack layout (bug #40373).
- Removed the spaces printed before the register names for the hppa disassembler
  in 4 places.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-127 release):
- Fixed a bug when the a zero fill section was attempted to be printed without
  -v which caused otool to core dump (bug #42127).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-122 release):
- Fixed a bug in printed byte swapped tocs for a dylib.  The code in main.c
  had some copy and paste errors in it's allocate() and memcpy() before the
  call to swap_dylib_table_of_contents().

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-119 release):
- Picked up first round of changes for the sparc target.  This work is
  incomplete.
- HPPA, changed main.c, otool.h, ofile_print.c and Makefile to fix bug # 39398
  (otool does not understand certain thread states for hppa). Added
  hppa_usrstack.c for the same.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-115 release):
- Changed print_symbol() in ofile_print.c to take an extra parameter, dot_value,
  the value of the address being dissassembled which is only used for the value
  of the -symbol in a SECTDIFF relocation entry if their is no symbol that
  matches that value.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-104 release):
- Made a quick but incorrect fix for jbsr disassembly in hppa_disasm.c by
  passing the sect_addr as the first parameter to print_immediate() in the
  jbsr case '@' this will not work if a jbsr to a different section is used.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-103 release):
- Fixed a bug in hppa_r_types[] array which has only 15 (not 16 enties).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-102 release):
- Integrated in the hppa support.
different otool/Makefile (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  New hppa files. Changed to remove hppa-opcode.h.
different otool/i386_usrstack.c (no changes for cctools-102)
     Using cctools-29. Late 3.2 fixes the hppa base did not have.
different otool/m68k_usrstack.c (no changes for cctools-102)
     Using cctools-29. Late 3.2 fixes the hppa base did not have.
different otool/main.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  Call to hppa_disassemble() added.
different otool/ofile_print.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  Printing hppa cputypes and relocs added.
     Fixed some print space problems in the master clone ~comp/cctools-29.
Only in cctoolshppa-37/otool: hppa_disasm.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Pickup cctoolshppa-37/otool/hppa_disasm.c from cctoolshppa-37 and
     Changed line 9 from:
	#include "hppa-opcode.h"
     to
	#include "../as/hppa-opcode.h"
     Changed line 412 from:
	struct scattered_relocation_info *srp, *spairp;
     to
	struct scattered_relocation_info *srp;
     to remove a warning.
     Changed line 630 from:
	return HPPA_RELOC_NORELOC;
     to
	return 0xffffffff;
     since HPPA_RELOC_NORELOC was removed from mach-o/hppa/reloc.h
   Changes for cctools-102:
     moved some functions into libstuff/hppa.c as suggested by the comments.
Only in cctoolshppa-37/otool: hppa_disasm.h (integrated for cctools-102)
     Pickup cctoolshppa-37/otool/hppa_disasm.h from cctoolshppa-37.
Only in cctoolshppa-37/otool: hppa-opcode.h (also NOT pick up for cctools-102)
     This is simmilar but different to hppa-opcode.h in ../as .  This was not
     picked up but hppa_disasm.c was changed to include ../as/hppa-opcode.h

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-101 release):
- Made sections with the attribute S_ATTR_PURE_INSTRUCTIONS disassemble with
  the -v flag.  Also had to fix the disassemblers to add sect_addr parameter to
  subract from the address when looking for relocation entries.
- Added -I to print the indirect symbol tables.
- Added code to print the dysymtab.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-100 release):
- First major round of changes for the new shlib stuff.
  1) In otool's disassemblers (m68k and i386) support for possition-independent 
     code through the SECTDIFF relocataion type.
- Fixed a bug in the m68k disassembler for mulsl where the 2 register form did
  not disassemble the Dl register correctly (bug #38530).
- Fixed a bug in the m68k disassembler for bcc branches of 16-bit and 8-bit
  displacements not getting their target calculated correctly (bug #38531).
- Fixed a bug in the m68k disassembler for dbcc instructions where the 16-bit
  displacements were not getting their target calculated correctly.

Changes for the 3.2 release (the cctools-24 release):
- Fixed a bug in print_argstrings() which was using printf(%s) and that could
  not correctly deal with a string that did not end in a '\0' before the memory
  that contained the string ended (bug #33672).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-22 release):
- Added printing for these  (bug #32553):
    { "any",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_MULTIPLE },
    { "little",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_LITTLE_ENDIAN },
    { "big",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_BIG_ENDIAN },

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-21 release):
- Fixed a few bugs in print_objc.c the had arguments reversed so things got
  swapped when they shouldn't have.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-15 release):
- Flushed out the swap_* stubs in print_objc.c.
- Updated the printing of the m98k cpu flavor to use it's correct definition.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-14 release):
- Added the opcodes for tlbiex (31,338) and tlbia (31,370).
- Changed the m98k instructions: lwarx, ldarx, stwcx. and stdcx. second arg from
  just a greg to 0 or a greg (r1-r31).
- For the m98k disassembler removed "mr" for "ori Rx,Ry,0" because the 0 could
  have a relocation entry and it really could be an "ori" not a "mr" (move
  register).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-13 release):
- Added the m98k (PowerPC) architecture.  This includes a kludged
  mach/m98k/thread_status.h with only an entry point.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-10 release):
- Fixed two bugs in the i386 disassembler.  First the displacement routine
  needed to sign extend it's value if it was a byte or short before doing the
  addition.  Second for the 8-bit jumps the operand size needs to be printed
  as a long not a byte (bug #29789).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-9 release):
- Fixed otool -c for the m88k and i386 architectures (bug #29639).  This
  required a file for each arch that included <bsd/XXXX/vmparam.h> so the value
  of USRSTACK could be returned.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-8 release):
- Added symbolic disassembly for the i386 arch.  This involved a major clean up
  of i386_disasm.c .

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-7 release):
- Added the i485 and i586 instructions to the dissembler for the i386 arch.
- Added a comment character '#' before in the sprintf lines
  "#***** Error - bad opcode" in _bits.c for disassembling the i386.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-5 release):
- Picked up the lono team's mods to ofile_print.c for changes to the i386
  thread_status.h.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-4 release):
- Changed the arch name from ix86 to i386.
- Changed CPU_TYPE_I80x86 to CPU_TYPE_I386 in main.c that was missed.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-3 release):
- Changed CPU_TYPE_I80x86 to CPU_TYPE_I386 and removed CPU_SUBTYPE_AT386
  CPU_SUBTYPE_EXL .

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-1 release)
- Created the otool directory with the 3.1 otool.
