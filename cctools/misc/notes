To Do:
- Add the -prebind_allow_overlap and  -prebind_all_two_level_modules to libtool
  see Radar bug 3417137.
- Change to Doug's approach to relayout, namely something like reserving the
  last 10% of the load region for new dylibs and then evenly spacing the
  existing dylibs in the other 90% (for split libs).  See email of 11/6/2000.
- Have cmpdylib check Objc info Tracker bug #78124.
- Fix a bug in strip on line 1105 where it uses missing_reloc_symbols when it
  could have been set otherwise and does not print the next line.
- Maybe add fat support for segedit(1)

Changes for the 5.33 release (the cctools-839 release):
- Changed the Makefile so that strip(1)'s use of <mach-o/prune_trie.h> and
  libprunetrie.a so that it comes from DT_TOOLCHAIN_DIR.  Radar bug #12296255.

Changes for the 5.32 release (the cctools-835 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) when the input was a .o file containg
  LC_FUNCTION_STARTS load command. The code in get_starting_syminfo_offset() in
  strip.c did not look for the load command which can be the start of the
  symbolic offset in the file.  Radar bug #11913911.

Changes for the 5.32 release (the cctools-833 release):
- Changed strip(1) to always use ld -r on ARM .o files to rename thumb symbols
  so they don't get stripped.  Radar bug #11795809.

Changes for the 5.32 release (the cctools-830 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit(1) when the input was a .o file containg a
  LC_DATA_IN_CODE load command. The code in get_starting_syminfo_offset() in
  strip.c did not look for the load command which can be the start of the
  symbolic offset in the file.  Radar bug #11554503.
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1) when run as ranlib(1) to not update the table of
  contents if the input archive's table of content's member name is not using
  the extended long name format and we create an table of contents with a 
  extended long name format (or vice a versa).  Radar bug #10399314.

Changes for the 5.31 release (the cctools-827 release):
- Added #ifdef guards for LTO_SUPPORT in lipo.c . Radar bug #11296366.

Changes for the 5.31 release (the cctools-825 release):
- Fixed the full strip case with -no_uuid that was not stripping the LC_UUID
  load command.  A call to strip_LC_UUID_commands() was added to strip_object()
  in strip.c for the full strip case.  Radar bug #11136733.

Changes for the 5.31 release (the cctools-824 release):
- Removed the creation of the link to /usr/local/bin/nmedit from
  $(DSTROOT)$(LOCBINDIR)/nmedit in the Makefile.  Radar bug #10688477.
- Fixed a bunch of places in libtool(1) that was using 32-bit variables to hold
  offsets and sizes.  Radar bug #10645295.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-822 release):
- The "low risk fix to strip(1)" below in cctools-821 for Radar bug #10718585
  breaks striping .o files with dwarf debug info.  Because the input file has
  an "ld -r" run on it so it is not the original input file.  That change has
  been backed out.
- The correct fix for strip(1) in dealing with code signed binaries is to
  added up the sizes of the output and input parts in the right order.  So the
  code in strip_object() has been updated to do this.  Radar bug #10709632.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-821 release):
- Made a low risk fix to strip(1) to fix bugs when stripping objects with
  code signature data.  The problem is that the code in strip_object() that is
  calculating object->input_sym_info_size is incorrect as it is not adding the
  elements up in their order and rounding the size for elements that are aligned
  like the code signature info. So as a low risk fix code was added in
  dyld_order() in checkout.c in libstuff that records the size of the symbolic
  information. Then in strip_object() it simply overwrites the previously
  incorrectly calculated value for object->input_sym_info_size with that.
  Radar bug #10718585.
- Fixed a bug in codesign_allocate(1) that was incorrectly using the value of
  sizeof(struct mach_header) for a 64-bit binary when testing if there was 
  enough room to add the load command.  Radar bug #10652697.
- Updated the code in pagestuff(1) to have parts for the dyld info and correctly
  handle dylib stubs who's section contents do not appear in the binary.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-820 release):
- Removed the use of vers_string(1) from the Makefile. Radar bug #10596469.
  - Updated libtool.c to print "Apple Inc." not "Apple Computer, Inc." and the
    comment where apple_version[] comes from.
  - Added a reference to apple_version[] in checksyms.c, cmpdylib.c, lipo.c,
    size.c, strings.c, nm.c, redo_prebinding.c, seg_addr_table.c, check_dylib.c 
    codesign_allocate.c, ctf_insert.c, seg_hack.c, install_name_tool.c, indr.c,
    strip.c and pagestuff.c.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-818 release):
- Fixed strip(1) to account for the size of the function starts data when the
  binary does not have a dynamic symbol table command.  It should have
  conditionalized on having a dynamic symbol table command but just the load
  command that has the data.  Radar bug #10506809.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-816 release):
- Changed ctf_insert(1) to allow a static binary with a dynamic symbol table
  load command that has local relocation entries.  Radar bug #10405248.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-815 release):
- Added the os_tools_install target in the Makefile that only builds lipo(1)
  and strings(1).  Radar bug #10391158.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-814 release):
- Changed strip(1) to use "ld -r" on 32-bit objects now that the blocking
  bug in ld(1) is fixed.  Radar bug #7076828.
- Added support for new load commands LC_MAIN, LC_DATA_IN_CODE,
  LC_SOURCE_VERSION and LC_DYLIB_CODE_SIGN_DRS.
  - Updated install_name_tool.c, pagestuff.c, redo_prebinding.c, strip.c,
    codesign_allocate.c, ctf_insert.c, indr.c and inout.c .
  Radar bug #10290817.
- Fixed ctf_insert(1) to correctly handle the LC_FUNCTION_STARTS load command
  and update it and move its data.  Radar bug #10171548.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-811 release):
- Changed the Makefile setting CXX to use c++ not g++.  Radar bug #10057952.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-809 release):
- Changed lipo(1) to determine the architecture of bitcode files, including
  as archive members.  Radar bug #9087924.

Changes for the 5.30 release (the cctools-808 release):
- Fixed a bug in create_library() in the loop that adjusted the ranlib structs
  ran_off was using the incorrect index value for:
    archs[0].toc_ranlibs[i].ran_off = archs[0].members[i].input_member_offset;
  which should have been:
    archs[0].toc_ranlibs[i].ran_off = archs[0].members[j].input_member_offset;
  Radar bug #9830754.

Changes for the 5.29 release (the cctools-805 release):
- Changed create_library() in libtool.c to check the new ofile bad_toc field
  and cause it to create a new library when this happens.  Radar bug #9475790.

Changes for the 5.29 release (the cctools-803 release):
- Changed libtool.c when running as ranlib(1) to attempt to update the table
  of contents in place for the common case for thin archives.  And removed the
  the time stamp checking for the "nop" ranlib case, which now ends up with just
  "touching" the file and adjusting the timestamps.  Radar bug #9354605.
  - Factored out existing code into new routines get_target_byte_sex() and
    put_toc_member().
  - Changed process() and removed the time stamp checking for the "nop" ranlib
    case.
  - Added the input_member_offset field to the struct member and added code to
    set its value in add_member().
  - Changed create_library() to take an ofile which is non-NULL if run as
    ranlib(1) and a thin archive.
  - Added code in create_library() to update the table of contents in place.
    And code to only "touch", write the SARMAG, if the table of contents is
    the same.  This code has to use the input_member_offset in cases that the
    thin input archive would not be same as produced by libtool(1) but still
    has member offsets at acceptable alignments.

Changes for the 5.29 release (the cctools-802 release):
- Fixed a problem with the change to libtool(1) for Radar bug #9354501.  It was
  not setting toc_uptodate to TRUE and was not doing this only when
  cmd_flags.ranlib == TRUE.  Radar bug #9418154.

Changes for the 5.29 release (the cctools-801 release):
- Changed process() in libtool.c to check that the table of contents was up to
  date based on the file's time stamp and the table of contents time stamp for
  archive files.  Then if it ranlib(1) being run do nothing if it is up to date.
  Radar bug #9354501.
- Fixed a bug in the error handling of pagestuff(1) when used with the -arch
  argument but missing an argument for which page.  Radar bug #8979851.

Changes for the 5.29 release (the cctools-800.3 release):
- Added support for armv7[fsk] to print_arch() in lipo.c .  Radar bug #8987684.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-798 release):
- Added this line to the Makefile:
    CXX = $(shell xcrun -find -sdk $(SDKROOT) g++)
  so that it uses the appropriate tool to link device-side code.  Radar bug
  #8684965.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-797 release):
- Added support for LC_DYLD_ENVIRONMENT in segedit.c .  Radar bug #8653976.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-796 release):
- Added checks in strings(1) to better protect against crashes if it is handed
  a malformed file.  Radar bug #8599283.
- Added the -arch option to pagestuff(1).  Radar bug #8379048.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-795 release):
- Changed ctf_insert(1) to allow the LC_FUNCTION_STARTS load command.  The
  change was in ctf_insert() in ctf_insert.c to remove the test for
  object->func_starts_info_cmd != NULL .  Radar bug #8490836.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-793 release):
- Fixed a problem in nm(1) not checking that a symbol is not undefined before
  checking that is a [symbol resolver] symbol.  Radar bug #8429570.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-792 release):
- Fixed more problems with incorrect support for LC_FUNCTION_STARTS.  There were
  missing output_func_start_info_data and output_func_start_info_data_size
  fields in the struct object that should have been used.  Updated the code in
  codesign_allocate.c, indr.c, inout.c, install_name_tool.c, redo_prebinding.c
  and strip.c which was incorrectly using output_split_info_data and
  output_split_info_data_size two use the new fields.  Radar bug #8401082. 

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-790 release):
- Fixed problems with the incorrect support for LC_FUNCTION_STARTS.  Radar bug
  #8274584.
  - Updated setup_code_signature() and setup_code_signature() in
    codesign_allocate.c .
  - Updated ctf_insert() in ctf_insert.c to treat objects with function starts
    info as an error and not allowed for static binaries.
  - Updated translate_dylib() in indr.c .
  - Updated setup_object_symbolic_info() in inout.c .
  - Updated setup_object_symbolic_info() and update_load_commands() in

    redo_prebinding.c .
  - Updated strip_object(), strip_LC_UUID_commands() and
    strip_LC_CODE_SIGNATURE_commands() in strip.c

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-787 release):
- Changed libtool(1) and added testing the environment variable ZERO_AR_DATE to
  set the ar date to zero to allow testing and comparing things for exact binary
  equality.  Radar bug #7919021.
- Changed lipo(1) to attempt to stop a crash if the file can't be paged in after
  it has been successfully mapped.  Added a second fstat(2) call in 
  process_input_file(1) just before the first bytes of the mapped file are
  referenced, and then checked that it has the same size and mod time of the
  first stat.  Radar bug #8087586.
- Added support in nm(1) for symbols marked with N_SYMBOL_RESOLVER so that they
  are printed with [symbol resolver].  This change is in print_mach_symbols()
  in nm.c .  Radar bug #7901954.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-784 release):
- Fixed the -arch_only flag in libtool(1) for arm so that each subtype is
  treated as separate architecture. Radar bug #7864127.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-782 release):
- Added the -U option to nm(1) to not print undefined symbols. Radar bug
  #7761111.

- Change contents_pointer_for_vmaddr() in redo_prebinding.c to ignore segments
  with a zero vmaddr since these are unmapped segments.  Radar bug #7467115.

Changes for the 5.28 release (the cctools-776 release):
- Improved the error checking in the redo_prebinding code so that
  contents_pointer_for_vmaddr() checks to make sure the pointer is in the
  section's contents of the segment.  Checks also added to libstuff's
  check_Mach_O() in ofile.c to make sure that sections are contained in
  their segments.  Radar bug #6081358.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-773 release):
- Fixed a typo in two lipo(1) error messages where "it's" should have been
  "its".  Radar bug 7362293.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-772 release):
- Fixed a bug in lipo(1) with the -extract option in main() in the loop that
  was removing those thin files not marked for extraction where the inner loop
  was looping once to many times.  Radar bug #7255585.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-768 release):
- Fixed a bug in checksyms() that was not verifying read-only-relocs in 64-bit
  binaries.  The routine check_dynamic_binary() had a typo where LC_SEGMENT
  should have been LC_SEGMENT_64.  Also changed checksyms() to not call
  check_dynamic_binary() if the filetype is MH_KEXT_BUNDLE.  Radar bug #7236271.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-762 release):
- Changed the Makefile to set CC when when SDKROOT is set.  Radar bug #7078805.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-760 release):
- Changed the lipo(1) so the the armv7 stuff is a no longer
  #ifndef __OPEN_SOURCE__ Radar bug #7016121.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-759 release):
- Changed check_dynamic_binary() in checksyms.c to allow read-only relocs in
  CPU_TYPE_ARM files in any segment with a section name of "__symbol_stub" or
  "__stub_helper" or section type of S_SYMBOL_STUBS.  Radar bug #6958263.
- Changed the Makefile to add -isysroot $(SDKROOT) to compile and link lines
  when SDKROOT is set.  Radar bug #6965029.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-757 release):
- Fixed problems with pagestuff.c that caused it to crash when run on 64-bit
  Mach-O files. Radar bug #6871695.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-756 release):
- Changed libtool.c, redo_prebinding.c and strip.c to prefix the commands they
  run with the path to the executable.  Radar bug #6821441.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-753 release):
- Fixed a warning about 'inew_nextdefsym' defined but not used by adding an
  #if defined(TRIE_SUPPORT) && !defined(NMEDIT) around the definition and
  #ifdef TRIE_SUPPORT around the use.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-752 release):
- Ported to build with clang.
  - Changed Makefile to work around bugs 6761248, 6765807 and 6756912.
  - Fixed two if() statements at the edit_symtab() in strip.c that incorrectly
    had ';' after them.
  - Fixed warnings about extra tokens at end of #endif directive in lipo.c
    by putting them in a comment.

Changes for the 5.27 release (the cctools-751 release):
- Fixed a typo in the usage message of install_name_tool(1) where it was using
  -rpaths that should have been -rpath.  Radar bug #6707169.

  relinked to suggest the use of -headerpad or -headerpad_max_install_names .
  Rdar bug #6632968.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-748 release):
- Fixed a problem in codesign_allocate(1) where it could produce a value for
  the filesize field of the LC_SEGMENT_64 for the __LINKEDIT segment that was
  too large.  The problem was in setup_code_signature() in codesign_allocate.c
  where it was using and expression of "X += Y - Z" where X was a 64 bit
  unsigned value and Y and Z were 32 bit unsigned values and Z was greater than
  Y. This casued the expressing become a large positive number rather than a
  small negative number.  The fix was to simply change it to two statements,
  X += Y and X -= Z;  Radar bug #6591303.
- Fixed a problem in segedit(1) that caused it to crash when replacing a section
  in a 64-bit Mach-O file.  The routne replace_sections() in segedit.c was
  incorrectly using mhp->ncmds in two place when it should have been using
  mh_ncmds .

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-743 release):
- Fixed the handling of LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB in redo_prebinding.c so that libraries
  with this load command are treated as sub images.  The change was in
  setup_sub_images() to add a two case lables for LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB and the
  code to match up the dylib_name in the dependents list and add them to the
  sub_images if not already there.  Radar bug #6555215.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-738 release):
- Removed the code and files for the old ProjectBuilder interface including the
  use of mig(1) in the Makefile.  The files make.defs make_defs.h were removed
  and the code in libtool.c had the code with these old interfaces removed.
  Radar bug #6457206.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-735 release):
- Changed strip(1) so it only calls prune_trie() when we are removing global
  symbols as is done with default stripping of a dyld executable or with the
  -s or -R options.  Radar bug #6476423.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-734 release):
- Fixed a problem in strip_LC_UUID_commands() routine that was not updating the
  object->dyld_info pointer.  Radar bug #6478235.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-733 release):
- Added support in strip(1) to update the exports in the compressed LINKEDIT
  information (trie data structure) when stripping a file that contains the
  info.  Radar bug #6257854.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-725 release):
- Added support for new compressed LINKEDIT information. Radar bug #6232822.
  - Changed strip(1), codesign_allocate(1) and install_name_tool(1) to copy
    dyld_info in the input to the output.
- Changed check_dynamic_binary() in checksyms.c to allow read-only relocs in
  CPU_TYPE_I386 files in any segment with a section name of "__symbol_stub" or
  "__stub_helper".

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-714 release):
- Changed lipo(1) to handle zero sized regular files specially since mmap(2)
  will not.  Radar bug #6169510.
- Changed libtool(1) to create separate fat archs for all ARM cpusubtypes. The
  Changes were in add_member() two places.  One for matching the existing
  archs[] and one for adding a new archs[].  Radar bug #6155212.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-713 release):
- Changed lipo(1) so when the call to mmap() fails in process_input_file() it
  now calls system_fatal().  Radar bug #6147708.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-712 release):
- Fixed a bug in codesign_allocate(1) if is used on a fat file with 
  LC_CODE_SIGNATURE load commands and not all fat archs are specified with the
  -a options.  The bug was in setup_code_signature() where when it did not find
  a matching -a option it attempted to adjust the object->input_sym_info_size
  which already had been done.  Radar bug #6128288.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-710 release):
- Fixed lipo(1)'s -i option to know about armv7. Radar bug 4545225.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-709 release):
- Added support for CPU_SUBTYPE_ARM_ALL to lipo -info command. Radar bug 6025863
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1)'s producing a table of contents for LTO.  The loop
  to size the table of contents was using the same outer loop variable in
  make_table_of_contents().  Radar bug #6064634.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-708 release):
- Changed libtool(1) to use use the ar long string format for the __.SYMDEF
  table of contents member so it will produce archive member offsets after
  that that are 8 byte aligned.
- Changed strip(1) to not produce an empty string table (but still include the
  pad) for 64-bit objects to work around Radar bug 6048484.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-707 release):
- Fixed a bug it the change to strip(1) to always run ld -r on 64-bit
  MH_OBJECT files.  The second place where it was calling make_ld_r_object() was
  missing a test for object->mh_filetype == MH_OBJECT.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-706 release):
- Fixed a bug in checksyms(1) that an MH_DYLIB_STUB filetype would incorrectly
  get a "malformed dynamic library (no LC_ID_DYLIB command)" error.  Radar bug
  #6035486.
- Changed strip(1) to always run ld -r on 64-bit MH_OBJECT files and then
  always keep all the resulting symbols.  This still has problems because
  the unified linker does not strip symbols not in its -exported_symbols_list
  file. Radar bug #5829662.
- Fixed a bug in codesign_allocate(1) for 64-bit objects it did not correctly
  extend the __LINKEDIT segment.  Radar bug #6000731.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-705 release):
- Removed the old ar.c, file.c, atom.c, check_hints.c, dylib_pcsampler.c,
  kern_tool.c and main.c sources and references to them in the Makefile.
- Added the private -l flag to strip(1) to do the "ld -r" even with the known
  bugs in the unified linker.
- Ported checksyms(1) and segedit(1) to work with 64-bit binaries.
- Ported all programs to run on 64-bit hosts.  Radar bug #6022298.
  - Changed the unsigned long type of nremove_symbols and nsave_symbols in
    strip.c to a uint32_t .   And narchs in strip_file(), ld_r_narchs in
    make_ld_r_object.
  - Changed the unsigned long type of narchs in main() in indr.c to a uint32_t .
  - Changed the unsigned long type of table_size in main() in checksyms.c to a
    uint32_t .
  - Changed the unsigned long type of temp in main() in libtool.c to a
    uint32_t .
  - Changed seg_addr_table.c use of unsigned long types to uint32_t types and
    its use of long types to int32_t types.  And changed %lu format strings to
    %u.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-704 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) so the zeroing out the UUID and the code signature
  data only happens with -u.  Radar bug #5984993.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-703 release):
- Ported libtool(1) to build as a 64-bit program.  Radar bug #5780008.
  - Changed two places that used SWAP_LONG to SWAP_INT.
  - Changed so the table of contents in now built with a new toc struct and
    tocs field in the arch struct.  And the toc_ranlibs field is now only used
    for writing to the file.
  - Changed all uses of unsigned long to uint32_t and updated printf format
    characters as needed.
  - Also changed to use mmap() instead of map_fd().

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-702 release):
- Changed checksyms(1) to allow the local symbol created by strip(1) for the
  fix to 5614542.  The fix was in checksyms() in checksyms.c to test for the
  symbol name "radr://5614542" and not count that as a local symbol or stab.
  Radar bug #5938033.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-701 release):
- Fixed a bug in install_name_tool(1) that was crashing when trying to print
  an error as it did not test for which mach header to use.  The fix was in
  update_load_commands() to add a test of the 32-bit mach header pointer and if
  NULL use the 64-bit mach header pointer. Radar bug 5932327.
- Changed the needs_redo_prebinding() API to use the allow_missing_architecture
  parameter so the check only applys to the slice requested isn't prebound.
  The change was in process_archs() in redo_prebinding.c to test the
  cputype of the file being processed against arch_cant_be_missing and if not
  the same just continue.  Radar bug #4701556.
- Changed strip(1) to avoid creating a file with an indirect symbol table entry
  with an index of zero into the symbol table.  This is due to a work around in
  the dynamic linker for a bug it is working around that was in the old classic 
  static linker.  The change was in strip_symtab() in strip.c add a local symbol
  if there are no local symbols and there are indirect symbols.  Radar bug
  #5614542.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-700 release):
- Removed the #include <objc/zone.h> from redo_prebinding.c. Radar bug #5911680.
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) -u to zero out the UUID and the code signature
  data.  Radar bug #5631467.
- Rewrote the -arch_blank implementation in lipo(1) so it handles all known
  arch flags. Radar bug #5547634.

Changes for the 5.26 release (the cctools-699 release):
- Backed out the changes for radar bug #3751608 which added code to
  redo_prebinding.c which sets a default value for __dyld section contents.
  Radar bug #5902653.
- Changed codesign_allocate(1) work with MH_OBJECT file types. Radar bug
  #5545465.
  - Changed setup_code_signature():
    - Changed the check for the flags having MH_DYLDLINK to also allow a
      file type of MH_OBJECT and updated the error message for that check.
    - Added a check for MH_OBJECT and in that case used the object file size
      for the "link edit end" to be used for the code sign data offset.
    - Changed two places where to check for object->seg_linkedit64 != NULL is
      now needed because the code can't assume the object has a link edit
      segment.
  - Also fixed a warning in main() where it needed a cast to (char *) for the
    assignment of the value returned by get_arch_name_from_types().

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-698 release):
- Added support for LLVM bitcode files to libtool(1).  Radar bug #5712460.
  It was added undef the ifdef LTO_SUPPORT and can be disabled by setting the
  LTO Makefile macro to nothing instead of its default -DLTO_SUPPORT .
  - Changed the Makefile and added the LTO macro defined to -DLTO_SUPPORT to
    enable LLVM bitcode file support.
  - Added support for LLVM bitcode files to libtool.c :
    - Added the lto field to the member struct.
    - Changed process():
      - To check the ofile->lto field for archives and if not NULL also call
        add_member().
      - Added a check for the ofile's file_type being OFILE_LLVM_BITCODE and so
	call add_member().  Added error if the program is ranlib(1).
    - Changed add_member():
      - to set the size of OFILE_LLVM_BITCODE files.
      - added checks when ofile->lto is not NULL and when -arch_only is
        specified and the arch does not match to return
      - added code when ofile->lto is not NULL and to select the matching
        archs[] if any.
      - added code when ofile->lto is not NULL to set the archs[].arch_flag of
	a newly allocated archs[]
      - added code when ofile->lto is not NULL to set the arch->arch_flag of
	and existing arch if not set.
      - added code when file->file_type is OFILE_LLVM_BITCODE to set the
	member fields.
      - added code when ofile->lto is not NULL to copy the lto field to the
	member struct and set the object_byte_sex field.
    - Changed make_table_of_contents():
      - Added code when member->lto != NULL to count the toc symbols from
	the lto module then add them to the table of contents.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-694 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) where it was crashing when stripping an MH_PRELOAD
  filetype because the code is dereferencing a pointer to the dynamic symbol
  table in get_starting_syminfo_offset() in strip.c.  The fix was to test
  object->dyst for not being NULL before using it.  Radar bug #5834516.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-692 release):
- Updated strip(1) to support binaries that use lazy dylibs. Radar bug #5828589.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-688 release):
- Maded changes for the new LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB load command. Radar bug #5760930.
  - Added case labels for LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB in update_load_commands() in
    install_name_tool.c in two places.
  - Added testing for LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB in lc->cmd in two places in nm() in
    nm.c .

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-681 release):
- Removed all __OPEN_SOURCE__ references in Makefile, notes, lipo.c, nm.c,
  redo_prebinding.c and strip.c .
- Added the -A option to codesign_allocate(1) to accept numeric architecture
  specifications.  Radar bug #5681427.
- Changed codesign_allocate to be a member of com.apple.tool.codesign_allocate .
  This is done by adding the new Info.plist file into the binary as part of the
  (__TEXT,__info_plist) section with a -sectcreate option on the link line
  in the Makefile.  Radar bug #5681503.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-679.1 release):
- Because of the bugs in ld(1), 5675774 and 5658046, the change to strip 
  dwarf for 5343015 has to be backed out.  The change is to simply #ifdef
  NOTDEF the test of has_dwarf and the call to make_ld_r_object() in
  strip_symtab().  Radar bug #5660086.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-679 release):
- Fixed a problem with the change made for Radar bug #5008421 where it would
  crash if doing a full strip on a file without a dynamic symbol table.
  The new code in strip_object() to account for the input symbolic info
  size needed to test that the dynamic symbol table pointer load command was
  not NULL.  Radar bug #5588769.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-677 release):
- Changed the Makefile to not use -Wno-long-double and -no-cpp-precomp .
  Radar bug #5563553.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-676 release):
- Changed it so ranlib(1) would not overwrite a file that is not writable when
  running in UNIX standard conformance mode (the default).  The change was to
  libtool.c in create_library() to add a check before it calls unlink(2).
  Radar bug #4242330.
- Added -fno-builtin-trunc to the Makefile to removed a warning when compiling
  libtool.c .
- Fixed a problem in lipo(1)'s -extract_family when used on a fat file with
  multiple cpusubtypes.  The fix was in an if() statement in create_fat() at the
  end where the if() before the seek() needed to also check nthin_files > 1 or
  extract_family_flag == FALSE.  Radar bug #4695968.
- Fixed the spelling of 'malformed' in redo_prebinding error messages.
  Radar bug #5188349.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-675 release):
- Fixed strip(1) to correctly do a full symbol strip and set the offsets to the
  indirect symbol table and local relocation enties.  The changes were to factor
  out finding the starting offset of the symbolic info from strip_object() into
  a new routine get_starting_syminfo_offset() and fixed the code in
  strip_object() for the full symbol strip case to correctly account for the
  symbolic info size and set the output offset to the local relocation enties
  and indirect symbol table.  Radar bug #5008421.
- Changed strip(1) to strip DWARF debugging info from object files.  Radar bug
  #5343015.
  - Added a new routine make_ld_r_object() that is passed the info for the
    current object file, writes that to a temporary file, runs "ld -r" plus the
    specified stripping option creating a second temporary file, reads that file
    in and replaces the object file contents with that and resets the variables
    pointing to the symbol, string and indirect tables.  The new ld_r_ofile
    field in the struct object from "stuff/breakout.h" is set in
    make_ld_r_object() so later free_archs() can call ofile_unmap() on it.
  - Changed strip_symtab() to see if the current object is an MH_OBJECT filetype
    and -S or -x is specified and the object has DWARF debugging sections to
    strip and if so calls the new routine make_ld_r_object().
  - Moved the local variables from strip_object for the symbol, string and
    indirect tables to file level statics so that the can be reset by the new
    routine make_ld_r_object().  And removed them as parameters to
    strip_symtab().
  - Changed the call to breakout() in strip_file() to save its ofile struct
    pointer return value so ofile_unmap() can later be called to clean up the
    space for the mapped object.
- Changed redo_prebinding to not put LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands in prebound
  images if MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is 10.4 or later.  The change was in
  update_load_commands() in redo_prebinding.c to test that if it is not
  not unprebinding and the target greater than 10.4 it returns before finishing
  up and updateing the LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-673 release):
- Changed the sources so the arm stuff is not in the open source version.
  Radar bug #5326431.
  - Changed the Makefile to build with -D__OPEN_SOURCE__ with $(OPEN)
  - Added #ifndef __OPEN_SOURCE__ to the following files to bracket arm code:
    lipo.c, nm.c, redo_prebinding.c and strip.c

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-667.3 release):
- Changed codesign_allocate(1) to never update the LC_ID_DYLIB timestamp.
  The change is in process() in codesign_allocate.c to set the
  dont_update_LC_ID_DYLIB_timestamp field in the arch struct to TRUE.
  Radar bug #5374218.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-667 release):
- Fixed two problems with the change below to strip(1) for Radar bug #5207629.
  - The new routine strip_LC_CODE_SIGNATURE_commands() should have tested the
    object's mh field to know which of seg_linkedit or seg_linkedit64 to use
    to reset the fileoff.
  - The object's output_code_sig_data field should not have been set when the
    cflags was specified.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-666 release):
- Changed strip(1) with the -c option to always remove any LC_CODE_SIGNATURE
  load command and signature data from the output.  The new routine
  strip_LC_CODE_SIGNATURE_commands() was added and it is called just after
  accounting for the signature data size in the input file and not accounting
  for it in the output file when the -c flag is specified.  Radar bug #5207629.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-664 release):
- Fixed a problem with the changes below to libtool(1) for Radar bug #5132019.
  When used in ranlib(1) on more than one file it would get an internal error
  in final_output_flush() on the second file as the last block from the first
  file was not cleared from the list.  The fix was to set output_blocks to NULL.
  Radar bug #5169741.

Changes for the 5.25 release (the cctools-663 release):
- Changed the code in checksyms.c, seg_addr_table.c and redo_prebinding.c for
  the new get_macosx_deployment_target() interface.  Radar bug #5132019.
- Changed libtool(1) to make it not make the machine unresponsive when building
  large static libraries.  Radar bug #5052598.
  1) Added the output_flush() and supporting code from ld_classic(1) and
     modified create_library() to use it.
  2) Added a call to fcntl() with the flag F_NOCACHE on the output file.
  3) Added a call to vm_msync() with the flag VM_SYNC_DEACTIVATE on the
     input object file's memory after copying to output buffer.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-661 release):
- Changed strip(1) to change LC_ID_DYLIB timestamp in unprebound dylibs.
  The change was in strip_object() in strip.c . Radar bug #5093170.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-656 release):
- Fixed codesign_allocate(l) as it was not updated to deal with 64-bit Mach-O
  files that may or may not have padding after the indirect symbol table.  This
  was the same change that was made to strip in Radar bug #4759112 but that
  same change did not make it into codesign_allocate(1).  The approach that is
  used is to use the input_indirectsym_pad field in the object struct as the
  amount to pad in the output file instead of trying to round the offset.
  Radar bug #5047066.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-655 release)
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) with the -no_uuid option when it is used on a file
  that has a LC_SEGMENT_SPLIT_INFO load command.  In the routine
  strip_LC_UUID_commands() it was not resetting the pointer to the
  split_info_cmd.  Radar bug #5033393.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-654 release)
- Changed libtool(1) to prepend the value of -syslibroot to all absolute paths
  of the -L flags if they exist in main() in libtool.c.  Radar bug #5029099.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-653 release):
- Updated install_name_tool(1), nm(1), redo_prebinding(1) and segedit(1) to
  handle the LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB load command.  Radar bug #4986624.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-648 release):
- Changed the check in lipo(1) for the nfat_arch being too large so the check
  does not overflow and later cause a crash.  Radar bug #4860769.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-647 release):
- Changed codesign_allocate.c to use CPU_SUBTYPE_MASK to mask out the capability
  bits from the cpusubtype on comparisons. Radar bug #4849153.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-644 release):
- Fixed problems with the error handling code of the libredo_prebinding API.
  The local varaibles used in the error handling needed to be declared volatile
  so that there were not trashed by the longjmp().  The ofile variable was
  getting set to NULL so the call to ofile_unmap() was not getting done and
  leaking memory (which in turn caused the file descriptor to not actually get
  closed leaking a file descriptor as well).  Radar bug #4800981.
- Changed lipo(1) adding code for the CPU_SUBTYPE_VEO_3 and CPU_SUBTYPE_VEO_4
  cpusubtypes.  Radar bug #4799550.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-643 release):
- Changed strip(1) so strip -X on an x86_64 .o file should do nothing.
  The change was in strip_symtab() for local symbols to check if the file is
  CPU_TYPE_X86_64 and the -X flag is used and if so keep all the local symbols.
  Radar bug #4800628.
- Ported cmpdylib(1) to work with 64-bit Mach-O dylibs including ones without
  a table of contents.  Radar bug #4040804.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-642 release):
- Changed needs_redo_prebinding() in redo_prebinding.c to return NOT_PREBOUND
  instead of PREBINDING_UPTODATE when the Mach-O file only contains 64-bit
  Mach-O files.  A new boolean variable, seen_a_non_64_bit, was added and
  initialized to FALSE.  Then in process_arch() if a 32-bit Mach-O is seen it
  set to true.  Then in needs_redo_prebinding() if PREBINDING_UPTODATE would
  have been returned and seen_a_non_64_bit is FALSE, NOT_PREBOUND is returned
  instead.  Radar bug #4788385.
- Fixed a problem with unprebind(3) in libredo_prebinding.a where it was calling
  update_external_relocs() even when the binary was marked with MH_CANONICAL.
  Radar bug #4786099.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-640 release):
- Changed lipo.c, strip.c, libtool.c, and indr.c to use CPU_SUBTYPE_MASK to
  mask out the capability bits from the cpusubtype on comparisons. Radar bug
  #4754462.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-639 release):
- Changed how strip(1) deals with 64-bit Mach-O files that may or may not have
  padding after the indirect symbol table. The approach now is to use the
  input_indirectsym_pad field in the object struct as the amount to pad in the
  output file instead of trying to round the offset.  Radar bug #4759112.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-637 release):
- Changed strip(1), inout(1), and codesign_allocate(1) to deal with the 64-bit
  Mach-O files that may or may not have padding after the indirect symbol table.
  The change was to use the new input_indirectsym_pad field instead of always
  rounding the size of the input indirect symbol table to 8 bytes.  And then
  adjust the output_sym_info_size and everything else to deal with padding the
  indirect symbol table on output if needed.  Radar bug #4747408.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-637 release):
- Changed strip(1), inout(1), codesign_allocate(1), and redo_prebinding(3) to
  deal with 64-bit Mach-O files with an odd number of indirect symbol table
  entries.  The code was changed to round the size or offset as needed in a
  number of places.  Radar bug #4737991.
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) when creating a shared library stub and not saving
  all the symbols used by the indirect symbol table entries.  In
  check_indirect_symtab() in symbols.c it was trying to update the non-lazy
  symbol pointers to the value of the symbol causing a memory smasher.  This
  happened because the offset to the section was set to 0 since its contents
  are to be stripped.  This casused the pointer to the contents to point to the
  beginning of the object file.  The fix is to not update the contents if we
  are creating a shared library stub since it is to be stripped.  Radar bug
  #4742051.
- Changed strip(1) to deal with N_SECT symbols with the N_WEAK_DEF the same for
  both 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O files.  The change was to remove a test of 
  object->mh64 != NULL in strip_symtab() in strip.c.  Radar bug #4732639.
- Fixed libtool(1) to check n_sect values of N_SECT symbols and issue an error
  if they are NO_SECT or out of range.  Radar bug #4739572.
- Added the printing of the alignment of common symbols to nm(1) when the -m
  option is used.  Radar bug #4597166.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-635 release):
- Added the -verify_arch <arch_type> ... option to lipo(1).  Radar bug #4496521.
- Changed strings(1) so that if it is used with a filename with parenthesis in
  the name it first checks to see if there's a filename that's an exact match.
  And if so it uses that, otherwise falls back to the member syntax.  The change
  was in main() in strings.c to stat(2) argv[i] and set a new boolean
  use_member_syntax when calling ofile_process().  Radar bug #4172811.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-634 release):
- Updated programs to handle the LC_SEGMENT_SPLIT_INFO command and its block of
  data. Radar bug #4695477.
  - Updated pagestuff(1) to include a new Mach-O part, MP_SPLIT_INFO, and the
    code and do the needed printing.  Also updated it to deal with code
    signature data.
  - Updated the inout.c to work with objects with split info data.  Also fixed
    it to work with code signature data and fixed a cast for the indirect
    symbol table now needing to be a uint32_t *.
  - Updated codesign_allocate(1) to work with objects with split info data.
  - Changed strip_object() in strip.c to set the output_split_info_data and
    output_split_info_data_size fields and account for the size of the split
    info data in the object's input_sym_info_size and output_sym_info_size
    fields.  Also set the data offset of the split info command for output.
  - Changed build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c to account for the
    size of the split info data in its local variable sym_info_size and
    set output_split_info_data and output_split_info_data_size fields.  And
    changed update_load_commands() in redo_prebinding.c to update the pointer
    to the split info load command.
  - Changed translate_dylib() in indr.c to account for the size of the split
    info data, and to reset the offset to it at the end of the routine.  Also
    changed the code to use the mh_cputype, mh_cpusubtype and mh_filetype
    fields of the object struct.
  - Changed setup_object_symbolic_info() in install_name_tool.c to account for
    the size of the split info data.  And changed update_load_commands() in
    install_name_tool.c to update the pointer to the split info load command.
    Also fixed update_load_commands() and added the missing break statements.
  - Fixed inout.c, strip.c, redo_prebinding.c, indr.c and install_name_tool.c
    to set the output_code_sig_data and output_code_sig_data_size fields.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-633 release):
- Ported the code for libredo_prebinding.a in redo_prebinding.c to be compiled
  for 64-bit hosts.  Note that the code only has been changed to work on 64-bit
  hosts and the operation on 64-bit binaries is unchanged (which is they are
  left untouched).  Radar bug #4407440.
  - Changed the macro U_ABS to use int32_t and uint32_t types.
  - Changed get_arch_long() and set_arch_long() to use int32_t and uint32_t
    types and SWAP_INT().
  - Changed the types of the static variables new_dylib_address and
    old_dylib_address to uint32_t.
  - Changed strip.c, indr.c and codesign_allocate.c to deal with the change of
    type for indirect symbols to uint32_t * when ported to 64-bit.
- Fixed a typo in seg_addr_table.c .  Radar bug #4677855.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-631 release):
- Changed libtool(1) to only execute ld(1) and execute ld64(1) based on the
  -arch flag.  The change was to create_dynamic_shared_library() in libtool.c
  Radar bug #4682470.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-629 release):
- Fixed a bug in the codesign_allocate(1) tool that was not updating the vmsize
  of the __LINKEDIT segment.  The fix was in setup_code_signature() in
  codesign_allocate.c . Radar bug #4666308.
- Changed strip(1) so strip -R on an x86_64 .o file should do nothing.
  The change was in strip_symtab() after checking the Rflag to check if the
  file is CPU_TYPE_X86_64 and if so don't remove the symbols in the
  remove_symbols list.  Then at the end of the routine the check to missing
  symbols in the remove_symbols is not done if the file is CPU_TYPE_X86_64.
  Radar bug #4568747.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-628 release):
- Changed strip_object() in strip.c to not do anything to stub dylibs which have
  no load commands.  Radar bug #4511628.

Changes for the 5.24 release (the cctools-626 release):
- Made changes to support code signature data in Mach-O files.  Radar bug
  #4588023.
  - Updated the inout.c example tool to work with 64-bit object files and
    objects with code signature data.
  - Created the codesign_allocate(1) tool and updated the Makefile to build and
    install it.
  - Changed strip_object() in strip.c to set account for the size of the code
    signature data in the object's input_sym_info_size and output_sym_info_size
    fields.  And update the data offset of the code signature data.  And at the
    end of the routine a warning is printed if the object has a code signature
    saying the operation will invalidate it.
  - Changed build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c to account for the
    size of the code signature data in its local variable sym_info_size.  And
    changed update_load_commands() in redo_prebinding.c to update the pointer
    to the code signature load command.
  - Changed translate_dylib() in indr.c to account for the size of the code
    signature data, and to reset the offset to it at the end of the routine.
  - Changed setup_object_symbolic_info() in install_name_tool.c to account for
    the size of the code signature data.  And changed update_load_commands() in
    install_name_tool.c to update the pointer  to the code signature load
    command.

Changes for the 5.23 release (the cctools-618 release)
- Changed checksyms(1) to not check for prebound files when
  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET >= 10.4 . The change was in check_dynamic_binary()
  in checksym.c to test the value returned by get_macosx_deployment_target().
  Radar bug #4110782.

Changes for the 5.23 release (the cctools-617 release)
- Changed create_fat() in lipo(1) to not set the timestamp of the output file
  if it contains archives.  Radar bug #4492604.

Changes for the 5.23 release (the cctools-616 release)
- Changed lipo(1) to special case ppc, ppc64, i386 and x86_64 architectures and
  to assume a segment alignment of 12.  Changes were made in get_align() and
  get_align_64() in lipo.c . Radar bug #4178258.
- Ported pagestuff(1) to work with 64-bit Mach-O's.  Radar bug #4375624.
- Added the needed code in for nmedit(1) in strip.c in check_object_relocs() to
  handle making global coalesced symbol in 64-bit Mach-O's private.  Basically
  it is the same as the 32-bit case but with quad sized relocation entries and
  64-bit values.  Radar bug #4414533.

Changes for the 5.23 release (the cctools-612 release)
- Changed strip(1) so strip -x on an x86_64 .o file should do nothing.
  The change was in strip_symtab() for local symbols to check if the file is
  CPU_TYPE_X86_64 and the -x flag is used and if so keep all the local symbols.
  Radar bug #4541291.

Changes for the 5.23 release taken from cctools-590.23.6 (the cctools-610 
release):
- Fixed a bug in the redo_prebinding code where it would call chmod(2) and
  chown(2) unnecessarily when no output_file is specified.  The fix was in
  unprebind() in redo_prebinding.c to remove the else clause of the
  if(output_file != NULL && outbuf == NULL) so the chmod() and chown() are not
  called on the file_name parameter.  Radar bug #4503724.
- Fixed a leak in the redo_prebinding code where error_message_buffer is not
  freed when system_error() is called.  The fix is in unprebind() in
  redo_prebinding.c after the first call to cleanup().  It checks to see if
  error_message_buffer is not NULL and if so calls free() on it.  Radar Bug
  #4503576.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.41.4 release):
- Change the previous fix to not reference the reserved1 field when fixing up
  indirect symbols in the non-lazy symbol pointer section. Radar bug #4522347.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.41.3 release):
- Fixed nmedit(1) so that it sets the value of symbol pointers when it changes
  the indirect symbol table entries for them into INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL.  The
  change was in check_indirect_symtab() in symbols.c and a bit of code was added
  to take the n_value from the symbol table entry swap it if needed and write
  into the section contents for that symbol pointer.  The additional parameters
  contents and host_byte_sex were added to the routine and pass from the two
  places it was called.  Radar bug #4514531.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.41.2 release):
- When stripping coalesced symbols from 64-bit files, only save symbols which
  are used as weak definitions. Radar bug #4487972.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.40.1 release):
- Ignore multiple -syslibroot flags if they specify the same argument. Radar
  bug #4354876.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.38.3 release):
- Fix a typo for 64-bit code in an error case in strip(1) which would cause it
  to crash. Radar bug #4502835.
- Add a new -arch_blank option to lipo(1). Radar bug #4473483.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.38.2 release):
- Don't convert external relocation entries to internal ones when looking at
  x86-64 relocation entries in nmedit(1). Radar bug #4497429.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.34.1 release):
- Revert the 4-byte alignment change in lipo from the previous release. Radar
  bug #4428605.

Changes for the 5.22 release (the cctools-590.31.4 release):
- Modified lipo to only require 4-byte alignment for load commands. Radar bug
  #4428605.
- Added x86_64 support to the relocation entry functions in misc/reloc.c, used
  by strip and other tools. Radar bug #4430570.
- Fix a typo in mach-o/reloc.h. Radar bug #3754196.

Changes for the 5.21 release (the cctools-590.40 release):
- Fixed a bug in pagestuff(1) where it would crash if it was processing a Mach-O
  file with no LC_SYMTAB command.  It crashed in print_symbols() because it
  lacked a check for fp->st not being NULL.  The fix was to add a check for
  fp->st being NULL and just returning in that case.  Radar bug #4495141.

Changes for the 5.21 release (the cctools-590.37 release):
- Changed check_indirect_symtab() in strip.c so that nmedit(1) and strip(1)
  would allow an indirect symbol table entry to just have INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS
  as well as (INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL | INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS).  This is because
  ld(1) puts this out in some cases.  Radar bug #4461173.
- Added passing ld(1)'s -t flag through libtool(1).  Radar bug #4213190.

Changes for the 5.21 release (the cctools-590.35 release):
- Added a warning to nmedit(1) when it sees a global coalesced symbol to say it
  can't make global coalesced symbols into a static symbols and suggest the use
  of ld(1)'s -exported_symbols_list option for a final linked images.  The
  change was in strip.c in edit_symtab() to add the warning an a boolean to
  only print it once.  Radar bug #4269492.
- Changed seg_hack so it doesn't affect debug sections.  Radar bug #4421656.

Changes for the 5.21 release (the cctools-590.34 release):
- Make 'nm: no name list' a warning, not an error.  Radar bug #4421611.

Changes for the 5.21 release (the cctools-590.32 release):
- Change edit_symtab in strip.c to handle the different format
  of the DWARF debug map.  Add new functions cmp_bsearch_global and
  cmp_bsearch_global_64.  Radar bug #4421583.

Changes for the 5.21 release (the cctools-590.31 release):
- Added the -no_uuid flag to strip(1) to remove LC_UUID load commands.  Radar
  bug #4415536.
- Added the -no_uuid flag to libtool(1) to pass on to ld(1).  Radar bug
  #4415529.

Changes for the 5.20 release (the cctools-590.20 release):
- Removed the warnings when building. Radar bug #4340147.
  - Added -fno-builtin-round to the Makefile.
  - Changed the local variable p to a char * in print_symbols() in nm.c .
  - Changed the cast of argument 3 of the call to bootstrap_look_up() to
    (unsigned int *) in tellProjectBuilder() in libtool.c .
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in the support for new i386 self (dyld)
  modifiying code stubs.  The problem was with calculation for the new
  displacement of the jmp instruction for non-prebound undefined symbols not
  taking in to account that the symbol is also being slid.  The fix was in
  update_self_modifying_stubs() in redo_prebinding.c code.  Radar bug #4335281.

Changes for the 5.19 release (the cctools-590.18 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit(1) when it tried to change a global coalesced symbol
  into a static and did not get the r_symbolnum for relocation entries set
  correctly.  The fix is in check_object_relocs() in strip.c where an extra
  check was needed of relocs[k].r_extern == 1 before updating the r_symbolnum
  field with the new symbol index.  Radar bug #4318688.

Changes for the 5.19 release (the cctools-590.17 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) if there is more than one non-lazy pointer section
  with the same indirect symbol that is being stripped.  The fix was in 
  check_indirect_symtab() in strip.c that needed to have a new made_local
  boolean and not always set saves[index] = -1 because that would cause the
  sections after the first one with this symbol not to be updated.  Radar bug
  #4316021.

Changes for the 5.19 release (the cctools-590.10 release):
- Added support for new i386 self (dyld) modifiying code stubs in the 
  redo_prebinding.c code.  Radar bug #4202415.
  - Added the new routine update_self_modifying_stubs() to set the JMP
    instruction values.
  - Changed process_arch() to call the new update_self_modifying_stubs().
  - Added the new routine reset_self_modifying_stubs() to set the self modifying
    stubs section back to halt instructions.
  - Changed unprebind_arch() to call the new reset_self_modifying_stubs().

Changes for the 5.19 release (the cctools-590.7 release):
- Changed libtool(1) to pass the new -macosx_version_min flag to ld.  Radar
  bug #4195253

Changes for the 5.18 release (the cctools-590.5 release):
- Added the N_OSO stab entry to stabnames[] array in nm.c to print the new
  stab.  Radar bug #4202462.
- Added passing the -Sp flag from libtool(1) to ld(1).  Radar bug #4202462.

Changes for the 5.18 release (and SUTiCambridge) (the cctools-590 release):
- Added a call to update_dyld_section() in unprebind_arch() in
  redo_prebinding.c to set the (__DATA,__dyld) section contents to a
  canonical value.  Radar bug #4126660.
- In reset_symbol_pointers() in redo_prebinding.c added a conditional resetting
  symbol pointers defined in the image.  The conditional is if either the
  MH_WEAK_DEFINES or MH_BINDS_TO_WEAK flags are present then the symbol pointer
  is set back to zero or to the value for lazy binding and assumed that if
  the symbol is defined it is being used from the image.  This is because the
  Tiger dyld when prebinding may set the symbol pointer to an address in another
  image even if the symbol is defined in the image being prebound.  Radar bug
  #4126666.

Changes for the 5.18 release (and SUTiAtlanta) (the cctools-588 release):
- Added more code in build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c for fix up
  the FCS Tiger dyld prebinding problem with stabs that are in the AppKit well
  enough to allow the Software Update patching that uses the undo prebinding 
  operation to work. Radar bug #4113681.
  - If the module table gets updated when unprebinding with the change below and
    that adjustment is not the same as the vmslide then the N_STSYM and N_SO
    stabs are corrected.

Changes for the 5.18 release (and in SUTiAtlanta) (the cctools-587 release):
- Added code build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c to fix up the FCS
  Tiger dyld prebinding problems well enough to allow the Software Update
  patching that uses the undo prebinding operation to work.  Radar bug #4108651.
  - When updating the module table when unprebinding code was added to calculate
    the value to adjust the objc_module_info_addr entries from the difference
    between the the address of the (__OBJC,__module_info) section and the module
    table entry with the lowest objc_module_info_addr value.
  - Code was added at the end of the routine to set the n_value of absolute
    global symbols that start with ".objc" or end with ".eh" to zero.
- Changed process_archs() in redo_prebinding.c to set 
  arch->dont_update_LC_ID_DYLIB_timestamp to TRUE for 64-bit archs so their
  time stamps don't get changed.  Radar bug #4105452.

Changes for the 5.18 release (the cctools-583 release):
- Changed the Makefile so that when RC_XBS is set to YES then the compiler
  options -MD and -dependency-file as well as the md(1) program are not used.
  Radar bug #4029936.

Changes for the 5.18 release (the cctools-580 release):
- Changed it so that the default for MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET is 10.4 for i386.
  Radar bug #4081062.
  - Changed the call to get_macosx_deployment_target() in unprebind_arch() in
    redo_prebinding.c to pass the additional cputype parameter from the arch's
    cputype.
  - Changed the call to get_macosx_deployment_target() in main() in
    seg_addr_table.c to pass the additional cputype parameter as CPU_TYPE_ANY.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-577 release):
- Fixed a bug in the libredo_prebinding code that caused it to report an error
  when there was a relocation entry at the very end of a segment.  The problem
  was in contents_pointer_for_vmaddr() in redo_prebinding.c where it was using
  < when it should have been using <= in checking to see which segment a vmaddr
  is in.  Radar bug #4054854.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-572 release):
- Changed nm(1) when the -P option is used to print a 0 for the size.  Radar
  bug #3652346.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-566 release):
- Ported strings(1) to work with 64-bit object files.  Radar bug #3943477.
- Fixed another problem with nmedit(1) and fat files with 64-bit Mach-O dylibs
  that have no modules.  The variable new_nextrefsyms was not being reset for
  the next arch being processed if it had no modules.  This is now done in
  edit_symtab() just after new_ntoc is reset.  Radar bug #3949527.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-565 release):
- Fixed a problem with nmedit(1) with -p option and 64-bit Mach-O object files
  that caused it to crash.  The problem was in edit_symtab() in strip.c where
  it was incorrectly using the variable changed_globals not changed_globals64.
  Radar bug #3945219.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-564 release):
- Fixed a problem with nmedit(1) and fat files with 64-bit Mach-O dylibs that
  have no modules.  The variable new_ntocs was not being reset for the next arch
  being processed if it had no modules.  This is now done in edit_symtab() just
  after new_nmodtab is reset.  Radar bug #3940965.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-563 release):
- Changed the code in redo_prebinding.c which sets a default values for the
  first two pointers in the (__DATA,__dyld) section, the routine
  update_dyld_section() was changed to use constant values.  Also a missing
  error check was added and calls to set_arch_long() to correctly deal with
  cross bytesex and alignment issues. Radar bug #3828403.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-562 release):
- Ported the install_name_tool(1) to work with 64-bit Mach-O files.  Radar bug
  #3930775.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-561 release):
- Fixed a problem with the code for nmedit(1) that could not deal with a dylib
  without a module table.  The fix was in edit_symtab() in strip.c to test for
  the number of modules being zero as well as it being a dylib.  Radar bug
  #3926028.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-560 release):
- Changed strip(1) to call realpath(3) on arguments to allow it to work with
  symlinks. Radar bug #3889109.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-559 release):
- Changed the printing in nm(1) with the -A option to add a space after the ':'
  is printed for the file name. Radar bug #3652346.
- Fixed a problem with strip(1) -c which was not correctingly setting the 
  filetype to MH_DYLIB_STUB.  This was caused by the changes to the 64-bit
  port and the fix was in strip_object() to set object->mh->filetype or
  object->mh64->filetype as well as object->mh_filetype.  Radar bug #3909472.
- Fixed a problem with the change for Radar bug #3766901 that was causing extra
  newlines in strings(1) output to be printed.  The fix was in ofile_find() in
  strings.c by only printing the +1 size of the string when it was at the end
  of the buffer and the last character was not a '\n' .  Radar bug #3907726.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-558 release):
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) avoid outputing libraries when they are built
  nonsplit but are listed as split in the table.  This situation happens when
  B&I moves libraries to the split region from the nonsplit region, but then
  they fail to build.  Radar bug #3903547.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-557 release):
- Removed support for the INTERIM_PPC64.  The changes were to remove the
  #ifdef INTERIM_PPC64 source changes in lipo.c and strip.c .  Radar bug
  #3600419.
- Ported the size(1) command to work with 64-bit Mach-O files.  Radar bug
  #3900014.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-556 release):
- For ranlib(1) with the -q option, used by ar(1) for UNIX standard conformance,
  a warning about an "empty library: XXX (no table of contents added)" must not
  be printed.  Again the change was in create_library() in libtool.c . Radar
  bug #3893339.
- For ranlib(1) with the -q option, used by ar(1) for UNIX standard conformance,
  changed it not to change the file if there are no table of contents entries.
  The change was in create_library() in libtool.c .  Radar bug #3893392.
- Added the -syslibroot <argument> option as another way to specifiy NEXT_ROOT
  in libtool(1).  Radar bug #3886145.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-554 release):
- Fixed a bug with the strings(1) -a option printing the last string at the end
  of a section.  The fix was in ofile_find() in strings.c by adding "+1" to the
  argument of printf()'s string size format.  Radar bug #3766901.
- Changed strip(1) to handled filenames with paths lengths near PATH_MAX.
  Radar bug #3878381.
- Made more changes to nm(1) for UNIX standard conformance.  Radar bug #3878451.
  - Added "--" to be the same as "-" and treat all remaining arguments as
    file names.  Change in main() in nm.c.
  - Changed nm(1) to print the file name before the output with -A just like
    the -o option.
  - Changed nm(1) with the -P option to use hex as the default.  Change in
    main() to the initialization of cmd_flags.format .
- For ranlib(1) with the -q option, used by ar(1) for UNIX standard conformance,
  changed it to not print the warning about creating a library with no symbols
  in the table of contents. The change was in create_library() in libtool.c .
  Radar bug #3878332.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-553 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit(1) for 64-bit Mach-O files that was causing it to
  incorrectly produce an error about bad n_sect values.  The fix was in
  edit_symtab() in strip.c where LC_SEGMENT was used when LC_SEGMENT_64 should
  have been used.  Radar bug #3880780.
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) for enhancements for 10.4 prebinding.  Radar bug
  #3871826
  - Only round addresses to the nearest page.
  - Only output split addresses.
  - Refrain from outputting the next debug and the next flat address to assign.
  - Allow addresses to be in the full 256 mb range (0x90000000 - 0x0x9fffffff).
- Changed redo_prebinding.c to ignore 64-bit Mach-O files and leave them
  unchanged.  Radar bug #3877703.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-552 release):
- Added the 'q' option to ranlib(1) to do nothing if a fat file would be
  created as the output file.  This is used by ar(1) for UNIX standard
  conformance.  Radar bug #3762136.
- Added the 'f' option to the usage line for nm(1).  Radar bug #3856321.
- Added the UNIX standard conformance flags -P, -A and -t to nm(1).  Radar
  bug #3652346.
- Added the -n number and -t format options to strings(1).  Radar bug #3644256.
- Added the "--" option to strings(1) to treat all argument after this as file
  names.  Radar bug #3571788.
- Changed strip(1) to not write over a non-writeable file when in UNIX standard
  conformance mode and produce an error instead.  The change was in strip_file()
  in strip.c to call the new libstuff routine get_unix_standard_mode() and if
  TRUE call access(2) for W_OK to see if we can write on the file. Radar bug
  #3852702.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-551 release):
- Fixed a bug in the -u option for redo_prebinding(1) that cause it to not set
  the MH_ALLMODSBOUND flag.  The fix was in unprebind_arch() after the call to
  update_load_commands() to re-read the value of the mach header flags it had
  in the local variable mh_flags.  Radar bug #3851599.
- Fixed a bug in print_mach_symbols() in nm.c that was causing a crash when the
  -m option was used because it was using ofile->mh64 when ofile->mh was not
  NULL.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-550 release):
- Changed nm.c to handle both 64-bit and 32-bit binaries.  Changed the Makefile
  back to the cctools-528 Makefile since there are no longer any *64(1) tools
  built in this directory.  Radar bug #3859090.
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) to ignore 64-bit files.  The changes were in 
  sizes_and_addresses() and get_seg1addr() in seg_addr_table.c to simply return
  if ofile->mh is NULL.  Radar bug #3861276.
- Changed the constant CPU_IS64BIT in libtool.c to CPU_ARCH_ABI64.
  Radar bug #3806447.
- Fixed a warning in build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c that the
  variables new_symbols64 and new_symbols may be used uninitialized.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-548 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) in strip_object() for 64-bit Mach-O binaries that
  caused it to not correctly update the indirect symbol table entries.  There
  was an incorrect cast in setting up the pointer to the section_64 struct where
  it was using "struct segment_command" where it should have been
  "struct segment_command_64".  Also there was an incorrect check of 
  object->seg_linkedit that should have been object->seg_linkedit64.
  Radar bug #3848104.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-547 release):
- Changed the code in redo_prebinding.c to not crash when presented with a
  64-bit Mach-O binary.  The APIs except redo_prebinding(3) should now handle 
  binaries with 64-bit Mach-O binaries.  There is not yet support for actually
  redoing the prebinding on a 64-bit Mach-O binary.  Radar bug #3851599.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-545 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip_object() in strip.c for 64-bit Mach-O files that
  incorrectly had the size on the indirect symbol table entries as 8 byte
  sizeof(long long) in two places.  This is an index into the symbol table and
  is 4 bytes in both 64-bit Mach-O files and 32-bit Mach-O files.
  Radar bug #3836060.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-542 release):
- Fixed 64-bit math bug in strip when computing the size of the __LINKEDIT
  segment. Radar bug #3831401.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-541 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip_symtab() in strip.c that was not correctly copying the
  undefined symbols out for both 32-bit and 64-bit Mach-O files.  Radar bug
  #3829545.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-540 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip_symtab() in strip.c that was using the value of a
  symbol's n_sect value before checking that it was in the valid range.
  Radar bug #3829149.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-539 release):
- Changed strip(1) to support 32-bit & 64-bit binaries.  Radar bug #3812858.
  - Changed the code in strip.c to to test the mach header field, mh for
    NULL, to see which type of object it has and then added/modified the code
    to deal with both.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-537 release):
- Changed the redo_prebinding(3) API to return REDO_PREBINDING_SUCCESS any time
  a new file is created.  Radar bug #3818477.
- Fixed a problem with libtool/ranlib that was causing it to increase the size
  of archive member's long names each time it was run.  The fix was in
  add_member() to first trim the long name size to not include any trailing '\0'
  before rounding the size up.  Radar bug #3817546.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-534 release):
- Changed libtool to call ld64 for CPU_IS64BIT architectures.  Radar
  bug #3807911
- Fixed lipo(1)'s -info and -detailed_info options to handle 64-bit Mach-O
  files.  Radar bug #3793539.
- Changed libtool.c to force using long archive names and pad them with the
  rounding needed to get members on 8 byte offsets.  This is needed because the
  struct ar_hdr is not a multiple of 8 bytes.  Radar bug #3808740.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-533 release):
- Changes to support 32-bit & 64-bit tools in the same binary.  Radar bug
  #3793394.
  - Changed the Makefile to only build libtool and no longer build libtool64 .
  - In libtool.c, changed the struct member, to have both 32-bit and 64-bit
    mach header pointers and array section pointers.  And changed all the code
    to test the mach header field, mh for NULL, to see which type of object
    it has and then added/modified the code to deal with both.  Also changed
    all rounding to 8 from 4 so members end up on a 8-byte boundary.
  - Changed the code in nm.c to use the swap_nlist_t and the swap_dylib_module_t
    new macros from "stuff/target_arch.h".  And added one ifdef ARCH64 to use
    the ofile->dylib_module64 .  Also added an 
  - In process() and in print_mach_symbols() in nm.c added a new ofile_mh local
    variable and added a new ifdef ARCH64 to set it to ofile->mh64 or ofile->mh.
    And changed places where it used ofile->mh to ofile_mh.
- Changed strip.c and segedit.c to initialize the variable progname and declare
  it to be a __private_extern__ to avoid having a common private extern be
  created when built with gcc-3.5.
- Changed the used of NXZone* APIs to malloc_zone* APIs in redo_prebinding.c.
  Radar bug #3461591.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-532 release):
- Fixed some problems with the Makefile and building libredo_prebinding.a when
  the support for 64-bit tools was first added.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-531 release):
- Made more changes to support 64-bit tools. Radar bug #3600431.
  - Changed the Makefile to build a libtool64 command and create a link to
    it for ranlib64.
  - Changed the libtool.c sources to build a libtool64 by changeing the uses
    of structs and constants that are different for 64-bit files to the
    typedefs in "stuff/target_arch.h".
- Made some changes to the changes in redo_prebinding.c in cctools-530 so that
  it does not compile with warnings.  And changed some of the comments to me
  more accurate.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-530 release):
- Added code to redo_prebinding.c which sets a default value for
  __dyld section contents. Radar bug #3751608.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-529 release):
- Made changes to support 64-bit tools. Radar bug #3600431.
  - Changed the Makefile to build the tools using a sub-directory for the
    objects and building both 32-bit and 64-bit tools.  Things are no longer
    built with -DINTERIM_PPC64 and the 64-bit tools are built with -DARCH64 and 
    linked with libstuff64 .
  - Made changes to build an nm64 by changing the uses of structs, constants
    and names that are different for 64-bit files to the typedefs in
    "stuff/target_arch.h".
  - In some places that used nlist symbols this was changed to the new type
    in "stuff/symbol.h" to struct symbol.  Which contains a name, an indr_name
    and an nlist_t.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-528.6 release):
- Change the code in nmedit that checks for relocation entries of
  global coalesced symbols to allow pcrel being 0 or 1.  This works as
  we are not moving the instruction and the pc value added in does not
  change.  Needed for x86 compilers after -1800 (3.3-based), and
  eventually necessary for 3.5-based x86 compilers. Radar bug #3806356.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-528.5 release):
- Fixed a problem with seg_addr_table(1) when it detects overlaps in both the
  read write and read only portions of a split address.  However it only will
  zero out the portion that has the overlap.  Later in seg_addr_table there is
  a check to determine if the address has been zeroed out and should have a new
  address assigned.  This check only looks at the read only portion of the
  address to decide if it should assign a new address.  The result of this bug
  is a library with a read only address that is non zero and a read write
  address that is non zero.  The fix is in main.c in the update and
  update_overlaps code.  Radar bug #3767036.
- Fixed unprebind's processing of nonprebound dylibs to allow it to 
  properly handle relocation entries.  Radar bug #3652989.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-527 release):
- Fixed a problem with the change for Radar #3738616 in that the checksyms(l)
  needs to have a what(1) string.  The Makefile was changed to put both the
  what(1) string and the apple_version[] info in vers.c . Radar bug #3746707.

Changes for the 5.17 release (the cctools-526 release):
- Added the -V flag to libtool(1) to print the version.  Changed the Makefile
  to produce the same version info in vers.c as is done for ld(1).  Radar bug
  #3738616.
- Fixed warnings for the changes in mach-o headers for types changing from
  unsigned long to uint32_t and from long to int32_t.  Radar bug #3744082.
  - Changed a number of uses of "%lu" to "%u" and "%ld to "%d" in lipo.c,
    size.c, nm.c, checksyms.c, cmpdylib.c and redo_prebinding.c .

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-524 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) that when used on the dynamic linker with no options,
  to strip all symbols, it crashed.  The fix was in strip_object() in strip.c to
  change it to make it call strip_symtab() when the file is an MH_DYLINKER.
  Radar bug #3697374.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-520 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) that when used on a dynamic library with no options,
  to strip all symbols, it produced a malformed file that had bad offsets
  to various tables.  The fix was in strip_object() in strip.c to change it to
  make it call strip_symtab() when the file is an MH_DYLIB.  Radar bug #3641669.
- Changed libtool(1) that printed "Logging for Build & Integration] Used static 
  library" to print the realpath() name of the file name.  Radar bug #3585834.
- Changed libtool(1) to take -executable_path as a linker flag.  Radar bug
  #3489733.
- Changed libtool(1) and ranlib(1) to not generate warnings about multiple 
  archive members defining the same symbol.  This is was done by adding the
  boolean parameter library_warnings to the function check_sort_ranlibs() in
  libtool.c and always passing this a FALSE.  This matches the way it is done
  in writeout() in libstuff.  Radar bug #3653845 .

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-512 release):
- Changed the two calls to writeout_to_mem() in redo_prebinding.c to pass the
  new enum bool * seen_archive parameter (it is not used in this code however).
  See the notes in libstuff for this, as it is part of the fix for Radar bug
  #3645280.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-509 release):
- Added #ifdef INTERIM_PPC64 to the source changes to support the interim ppc64
  file format.  And added -DINTERIM_PPC64 to the Makefile.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-500 release):
- Added in nm(1) when -m is specified printing "[no dead strip] " for symbols
  with the N_NO_DEAD_STRIP bit set.  This change is in print_mach_symbols() in
  nm.c .  Radar bug #2284500.
- Changed libtool(1) to take -dead_strip and -no_dead_strip_inits_and_terms
  as linker flags.  Radar bug #2284500.

Changes for the 5.16 release (the cctools-499.1 release):
- Added support for the interim ppc64 file format. Radar bug #3562133 and
  #3562232.
  - Updated lipo.c to know about CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64 in print_arch() and
    print_cputype().
  - Updated strip_object() in strip.c so the stride for symbol pointers is set
    8 when arch_flag.cputype == CPU_TYPE_POWERPC64 and 4 otherwise.

Changes for the 5.14 release (the cctools-497 release):
- Added passing the -prebind_allow_overlap from libtool(1) to ld(1).  Radar bug
  #3452484.

Changes for the 5.14 release (the cctools-496 release):
- Fixed a bug that caused the seg_addr_table(1) tool to reserves more space
  than necessary for flat dylibs.  Radar bug #3440884.

Changes for the 5.13.2 release (the cctools-495.3 release):
- Added a -u option to redo_prebinding(1) and the unprebind(3) API to allow
  binaries to be "unprebound".  Unprebound binaries are identified by the
  MH_PREBINDABLE flag.  The unprebind operation will remove all
  LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB load commands, set LC_LOAD_DYLIB load command's timestamps
  to zero, slide dynamic libraries to address 0x0, set prebound symbols' symtab
  entries to be of type N_UNDF and address zero, resets lazy symbol pointers to
  their original values as specified in their corresponding relocation entries,
  sets non-lazy symbol pointers to zero, and sets two-level hints to zero.  If
  a dynamic library has all two-level namespace modules bound, the unprebound
  binary will also have the MH_ALLMODSBOUND flag set (because this fact is lost
  when the LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands are removed).  It is also 
  possible to unprebind non-prebound dylibs, executables, and bundles.  
  These files do not gain the MH_PREBINDABLE flag, however they will have 
  their dependent library timestamps and versions zeroed, and their hints 
  table will be zeroed as well.  As unprebind is intended to produce a 
  canonical Mach-O, all unprebound binaries are identified with the 
  MH_CANONICAL flag.  Radar bug #3176679.
- Added a -s option to redo_prebinding(1).  If -s is specified, the resulting
  output file will be written to standard output, rather than to an output file.
  Radar bug #3176679.
- Added a -seg1addr option to redo_prebinding(1).  If -seg1addr is specified,
  the next command-line argument should be a valid hexadecimal address.  
  redo_prebinding(1) will then slide the input dynamic library to this address.
  This option does not apply when -u, -seg_addr_table or
  -seg_addr_table_filename are specified.
- Modified the redo_prebinding code to support reprebinding of unprebound
  binaries.  This included recognizing binaries with MH_PREBINDABLE as opposed
  to MH_PREBOUND as binaries acceptable for reprebinding, using the
  MH_ALLMODSBOUND flag (or lack thereof) to determine if all two-level namespace
  modules should be bound for input binaries with MH_PREBINDABLE, and changing
  the type of the input symbols to N_PBUD if the type was read in as N_UNDF and
  the file has MH_PREBINDABLE set in setup_initial_undefined_list() (this is
  because these symbols can be assumed to have been prebound symbols prior to
  the file being unprebound, and these symbols must be treated as prebound
  during the reprebinding process).  Radar bug #3176679.

Changes for the 5.13 release (the cctools-493 release):
- Fixed a bug in the redo_prebinding code that was incorrectly checking that an
  executable does not have any extra LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB load commands for
  libraries that don't exist.  This can cause an error if an indirectly
  referenced dylib's install name changes.  This is not needed since
  update_load_commands() will recreate the LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB load commands for
  the indirectly referenced dynamic libraries.  Including both adding and
  removing ones as needed to match the libraries on the system.  Radar bug
  #3408696.

Changes for the 5.13 release (the cctools-492 release):
- Changed the seg_addr_table(1) tool to assign addresses for _debug and _profile
  libraries addresses to start at 0x40000000 through lower addresses.  Radar
  bug #3360593.
- Fixed a bug in the seg_addr_table(1) tool where the bounds checking in
  next_flat_seg1addr was not entirely correct.  The fix is two places in
  next_flat_seg1addr() in seg_addr_table.c . Radar bug #3359505.

Changes for the 5.13 release (the cctools-483 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1)'s handling of -weak_framework and -weak_library
  flags.  The code in the routine process() in libtool.c needed the same check
  for -framework to avoid thinking the flag as a file name and trying to open
  it.  Radar bug #3318491.
- Changed libtool(1) to pass the -m flag on to the linker.  Radar bug #3305123.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-474 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding that was leaking memory if the
  allow_missing_architectures parameter was used and the fat file did not
  contain an architecture.  The fix was in load_library() in 4 places it
  checks to see if the missing architecure is allowed to be missing and it now
  unmap's the ofile before returning.  Radar bug #3144803.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-472 release):
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(1) when run with -relayout the <<< Next split
  address to assign >>> isn't getting set properly.  The fix in in main() to add
  relayout == FALSE to the if() condition for the code that loops and updates
  the NEXT_SPLIT_ADDRESS_TO_ASSIGN.  Radar bug #3245958.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-470 release):
- Added the -c option to strip(1) to strip the section contents of a dynamic
  shared library and create a stub library.  Radar bug #3235093.
- Changed install_name_tool(1) to not change MH_DYLIB_STUB filetypes.  
  Radar bug #3235093.
- Added the flag -search_paths_first to cause -lx flags to search each path
  for .dylib then .a before searching next path to libtool(1).  Radar bug
  #3176974.
  - Added the enum bool variable search_paths_first to the cmd_flags struct and
    code to parse out the option, set variable and add it to the ldflags[] in
    main() .
  - The new static routines search_paths_for_lname() and search_path_for_lname()
    were added.
  - In file_name_from_l_flag() a test of the new search_paths_first variable is
    done and if TRUE then search_paths_for_lname() is called.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-469 release):
- Added support for the -weak-lx, -weak_library and -weak_framework flags to
  libtool(1).  Radar bug #3069758.
- Fixed a bug seg_addr_table(1) in next_flat_seg1addr() where the variable i
  was previously changed to unsigned.  The second loop uses this varaiable as
  signed and thus this change was causing the loop to never terminate.  Radar
  bug 3225931.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-466 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1) for the -static option that caused it to crash if
  the objects contained no symbols to put in the table of contents.  Radar bug
  #3217471.
- Fixed the incorrect casts on the comparison of the nlist struct's n_strx field
  where the value being compared to was casted to a long.  The correct fix was
  to cast n_strx to an unsigned long.
- Changed print_mach_symbols() in nm.c to print "(dynamically looked up)" for
  the library ordinal DYNAMIC_LOOKUP_ORDINAL which are looked up dynamically
  with flat namespace semantics in two-level namespace images.  Radar bug
  #3210803.
- Changed get_primary_lib() in redo_prebinding.c to check for the library
  ordinal DYNAMIC_LOOKUP_ORDINAL and return NULL.  Radar bug #3210803.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-464 release):
- Made changes to build cleanly with gcc3.3
  - Removed -Wno-precomp from the Makefile
  - Fixed warnings for "comparison between signed and unsigned" in lipo.c,
    size.c, strings.c, nm.c, libtool.c, checksyms.c, indr.c, strip.c, segedit.c,
    kern_tool.c, cmpdylib.c, dylib_pcsampler.c, pagestuff.c, redo_prebinding.c,
    seg_addr_table.c, check_dylib.c, seg_hack.c and install_name_tool.c.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-463 release):
- Added support for MH_DYLIB_STUB libraries.  Radar bug #3193744.
  - Added the testing for MH_DYLIB_STUB along with MH_DYLIB in add_member()
    in libtool.c .
  - Added the testing for MH_DYLIB_STUB along with MH_DYLIB in
    translate_object() in indr.c in the error check.
  - Added a case for MH_DYLIB_STUB in type_buf() in file.c (note this is the
    old file(1) command and is no longer used).
  - Added the testing for MH_DYLIB_STUB along with MH_DYLIB in check_dylib()
    in cmpdylib.c in 2 places.
  - Added the testing for MH_DYLIB_STUB along with MH_DYLIB in checksyms() and
    in check_dynamic_binary() in checksyms.c in 3 places in all.
  - Added the testing for MH_DYLIB_STUB along with MH_DYLIB in check_hints.c .

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-461 release):
- Fixed a bug in install_name_tool(1) that caused it to crash when the new
  load commands were smaller than the old load commands.  Radar bug #3161586.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-456 release):
- Fixed a bug in the redo_prebinding code when the allow_missing_architectures
  parameter to the redo_prebinding() API is non-zero.  In the routine
  load_library() an extra check is needed to not cause an error if we are
  allowing missing architectures.  The case where this happens is when there
  is a fat file that the architecture we don't care about depends on a library
  in another fat file but the time stamps for the libraries don't match.
  Radar bug #3144552.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-455 release):
- Fixed a bug in the redo_prebinding code in the routine link_library_module()
  in redo_prebinding.c.  The problem was that when a reference to a private
  extern was found only the module containing it was marked linked.  A call
  to link_library_module() for that module was needed to pull in its
  dependencies and get those modules marked as LINKED.  Radar bug #3126383.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-454 release):
- Fixed a bug where seg_addr_table doesn't catch when an address is assigned in
  the "alternate" area.  seg_addr_table(1) was using the wrong constant to
  check the validity of newly assigned addresses, the fix is to use the correct
  constant.  Radar bug #3138181.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-452 release):
- Fixed the bug fix done for Radar bug #3124262 below in the redo_prebinding
  code. The copied code from the above loop was wrong as it changed this:
                   if(libs[i].module_states[j] == LINKED)
  to this:
                   if(libs[j].module_states[k] == LINKED ||
                      (prebind_all_twolevel_modules == TRUE &&
                       (libs[j].ofile->mh->flags & MH_TWOLEVEL) ==
                                MH_TWOLEVEL))
  which should have been this:
                   if(libs[i].module_states[j] == LINKED ||
                      (prebind_all_twolevel_modules == TRUE &&
                       (libs[i].ofile->mh->flags & MH_TWOLEVEL) ==
                                MH_TWOLEVEL))
  which used the correct index variables.  Radar bug #3133589.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-451 release):
- Fixed a bug in the redo_prebinding code that did not set the all the bits
  in the linked_modules bit vector for any new LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB load commands
  when prebind_all_twolevel_modules was TRUE.  Radar bug #3124262.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-448 release):
- Added an entry stabnames[] array in nm.c for N_OPT that is emitted with
  gcc2_compiled and in gcc source.  Radar bug #3104328.

Changes for the 5.12 release (the cctools-447 release):
- Fixed a bug in add_member() in libtool.c when get_arch_family_from_cputype()
  returns NULL.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-446 release):
- Added passing -x from libtool to ld.  Radar bug #3088301.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-444 release):
- Added passing -exported_symbols_list & -unexported_symbols_list from libtool
  to ld.  Radar bug #3083844.
- Factored out some of the symbol list stuff out of strip.c into libstuff so
  ld(1)'s -exported_symbols_list and -unexported_symbols_list options can use
  it.  Radar bug #3083844.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-443 release):
- Added passing -single_module & -multi_module from libtool to ld.  Also added
  passing -u flags.  Radar #3080780.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-440 release):
- Fixed the warnings about extra tokens at end of #endif directive in
  check_hints.c, strip.c and make_defs.h (Radar bug #3072042).

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-439 release):
- Made the needed changes to lipo.c for VEO support.  Radar bug #3068161.
- Added the install_name() API to redo_prebinding.c . Radar bug #3065586.
- Changed needs_redo_prebinding() in redo_prebinding.c to check all archs if
  allow_missing_archs is zero.  Radar bug #3065577.
- Added parsing out -no_arch_warnings to libtool(1), which is then ignored,
  so it can be passed to it.  Radar bug #3064819.

Changes for the 5.11 release (the cctools-437 release):
- Backed out Radar bug #2922145 and changed the Makefile back to only create
  only -dynamic compiled libredo_prebinding.a. Radar bug #3000895.
- Add support in nm(1) for printing the new stab entries for Radar bug #2940311
  which should be:
	N_PARAMS	0x86
	N_VERSION	0x88
	N_OLEVEL	0x8A
  Also needed to fix a couple of places that did not check the N_STAB being zero
  before checking the N_TYPE bits to be N_INDR (which N_OLEVEL has).
  Radar bug #3000792.
- Fixed a bug in setup_symbol_list() in strip.c in the code that removes
  duplicates from the list.  The second loop limit needed to loop for one
  less.  Radar bug #2962899.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-435 release):
- Fixed bugs in the libredo_prebinding API's of object_file_type() and
  get_prebind_cksums() that were not calling setjmp() to set up for handling
  of errors.  Radar bug #2992414.
- Changed redo_prebinding to not attempt to redo the prebinding on any file
  that has a resource fork.  The test is made deep in the code just before it
  would actually do the work.  It is done this way to not mess up the other
  options like -i that is trying to ignore non-Mach-O files, etc.  Radar bug
  #2987656.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-434 release):
- Changed nmedit -p to not change the indirect table entries to
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL since the symbols are still global.  Radar bug 2986703.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-432 release):
- Changed libtool(1) when the -static option is in effect to not put a dynamic
  library file into the static library it is creating.  This can happen if a
  libx.a file is really a dynamic library and someone is using -lx when creating
  a static library.  The change is in add_member() in libtool.c.  Radar bug
  #2970223.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-430 release):
- Changed the experimental code in nmedit that changes global coalesced symbols
  into statics to do very limited relocation.  It can do VANILLA long sized
  non-pcrel relocation.  It does not correctly convert it to a scattered
  relocation entry when it should.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-429 release):
- Fixes a bug with the experiment in cctools-428 that was changing global
  coalesced symbols into statics.  A static symbol can't be a weak_definition
  and ld(1) catches this as an error.  So in edit_symtab() just after it cleared
  the N_EXT bit it also clears the N_WEAK_DEF bit.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-428 release):
- As an experiment changed nmedit(1) when using the -s option on an MH_OBJECT
  file change change global coalesced symbols into statics.  Then if there are
  external relocation entries to just turn them into local entries without
  knowing if they should be scattered relocation entries.  Radar bug #2957909.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-427 release):
- Changed nmedit(1) -p to also change global coalesced symbols into private
  externs.  The change was in edit_symtab() in strip.c.  Radar bug #2956057.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-422 release):
- Changed strip_symtab() in strip.c to strip local symbols in sections that have
  the S_ATTR_STRIP_SYMS section attribute in files linked for dyld.  Radar bug
  #2945659.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-421 release):
- Fixed a bug in the redo_prebinding(3) API where the internal static variable
  check_if_needed was not reset in reset_statics().  Radar bug #2933102.
- Picked up the changes to seg_addr_table(1) for the new -relayout_nonsplit
  option.  Radar bug #2935630.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-420 release):
- Added the -M flag to libtool to passing through to ld(1).  Radar bug #2935497.
- Changed what the needs_redo_prebinding() API and the redo_prebinding() API
  (when the only_if_needed parameter is non-zero) returns for statically linked
  executables.  In this case needs_redo_prebinding() now returns NOT_PREBINDABLE
  and redo_prebinding() returns REDO_PREBINDING_NOT_NEEDED.  Radar bug #2934831.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-417 release):
- Changed the Makefile to create both a -static compiled and a -dynamic
  compiled libredo_prebinding.{dylib,a} pair.  Radar bug #2922145.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-416 release):
- Changed print_mach_symbols() in nm.c to also print "weak" for symbols with
  the N_WEAK_DEF bit set.  Removed the code to test for sections with the
  S_ATTR_WEAK_DEFS attribute. Radar bug #2919646.
- Fixed a problem with redo_prebinding updating the LC_ID_DYLIB time_stamp for
  archs that were missing.  This is done in build_new_symbol_table() by setting
  the new dont_update_LC_ID_DYLIB_time_stamp field.  Radar bug #2914003.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-415 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) to detect when an executable was built with the
  -prebind_all_twolevel_modules and then bind all twolevel modules on output.
  Radar bug #2909518.
- Added pass the -ObjC flag from libtool to ld.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-414 release):
- Changed print_mach_symbols() in nm.c to also print "weak" for symbols in a
  section with the S_ATTR_WEAK_DEFS attribute.  Radar bug #2898558.
- Changed seg_addr_table(1)'s default adresses for Mac OS X 10.2 to be
  0x8fe00000 not 0x7fe00000.  Radar bug #2897418.
- Added the new routine check_for_extra_LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB() in redo_prebinding.c
  and a call to it in process_arch().  This is done to match dyld's checking
  for extra LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands an not use the prebinding.  Radar bug
  #2894021.
- Fixed the arguments to the fprintf() call on line 762 in redo_prebinding.c .

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-413 release):
- Changed seg_addr_table(1)'s default adresses for Mac OS X 10.2 to be
  0x7fe00000 not 0x7ffc0000.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-412 release):
- Fixed a problem with the redo_prebinding(3) library routine when it is passed
  zero for the slide_to_address parameter.  The static variable dylib_vmslide
  did not get reset in reset_statics() like it should.  Radar bug #2882844.
- Changed seg_addr_table() to not cause an error when the project that builds
  a library can't be found in the -update or -update_overlaps mode.  This was
  done by passing a new no_error_if_missing parameter to get_image_file_name()
  which pass it down to get_symfile_for_dylib() and get_dstfile_for_dylib().
  Radar bug #2882324.
- Fixed a bug in strings(1) that was passing the process_non_objects to
  ofile_process() as FALSE when it should have been TRUE.  Radar bug #2868578.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-411 release):
- Changed seg_addr_table(1)'s default adresses for Mac OS X 10.2 to be based on
  the value MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.  Also added the flag -allocate_flat
  with the increasing or decreasing argument to allow the flat libraries to be
  allocated in decreasing addresses.  Radar bug #2848945.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-406 release):
- Changed dependent_libs(3) to work for MH_BUNDLE type objects. Radar bug
  #2862297.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-405 release):
- Changed the implementation of the fix to strip below slightly.  The code to
  check if a local private extern was on the save list was moved ahead of
  other checks in strip_symtab().  This is needed to avoid an error saying the
  symbols names listed in save file was not in the object file.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-404 release):
- Changed strip(1) to fix the problem with the fix to strip private externs
  that were turned into statics which was Radar bug #2853161.  This change
  caused some private extern coalesced symbols used through indirect symbols
  not to be saved.  The fix was to copy the code to check for coalesced symbols
  used by indirect symbols into the local symbol if case.  Then as it turned out
  some other non-coalesced local symbols were being used via indirect symbols
  so the test for the symbol being coalesced was removed and only the test for
  using it through an indirect symbol remains.  The new Radar bug is 2860291.
- Changed weak_module to be static in redo_prebinding.c.  Radar bug #2859919.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-403 release):
- Changed the all target in the Makefile to also depend on lib_ofiles so
  everything gets built by default.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-402 release):
- Changed strip(1) to strip private externs that were turned into statics that
  are in a dynamic library that are not referenced by a module other than where
  the symbols is defined.  Radar bug #2853161.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-400 release):
- Changed the Makefile back to again use the -dependency-file with gcc.
- Changed seg_addr_table to not generate errors about table entries that do not
  exist when -update or -update_overlapps are specified.  Radar bug #2848667.
- Changed check_syms to not check dynamic shared library addresses.  The code
  in check_dylib() was ifdef'ed out.  Radar bug #2847857.
- Fixed a bug in the change to strip that stripped coalesced symbols that are
  not used with an indirect symbol table entry by default. Radar bug #2689894.
  The problem is that the setting of output_indirect_symtab was not done for the
  strip (not NMEDIT case) when it was moved up.  Radar bug #2851013.
- Added the new throttle parameter to the redo_prebinding() API to allow it to
  be used used for prebinding on demand to throttle back its I/O when running
  in the back ground.  Radar bug #2850642.
- Changed indr.c, strip.c, seg_hack and install_name_tool to add the new
  throttle parameter to writeout().  Radar bug #2850642.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-399 release):
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) in the -update or -update_overlapps case to not
  check that non-zero addresses in the table match the addresses in the dynamic
  library file.  Radar bug #2841199.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-398 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding to check if the library has already been loaded via
  the dev,ino pair from stat(2).  This change is in load_library() and the
  fields dev,ino have been added to the lib struct.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-397 release):
- Added the new allow_missing_architectures parameter to the 
  needs_redo_prebinding() API.  Radar bug #2836068.
- Added the -multiply_defined_unused flag to libtool.  Radar bug #2835152.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-396 release):
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) to not use the SYMROOT file when -update is used.
  Radar bug #2826945.
- Added passing the -weak_reference_mismatches flag from libtool to ld.
- Added the new allow_missing_architectures parameter to the redo_prebinding()
  API in <mach-o/redo_prebinding.h>. Radar bug #2809673.

  In API redo_prebinding() the new allow_missing_architectures parameter gets
  set into the static variable arch_cant_be_missing.

  In load_library() where it checks for missing architectures it tests the
  static variable arch_cant_be_missing for non-zero and compares it to the
  arch_flag.cputype.  If set and it does not match load_library() was changed
  to return FALSE (previously void) else it returns TRUE.

  In load_archs_libraries() and load_dependent_libraries() which calls
  load_library() if load_library() returns FALSE these two calls also return
  FALSE.

  Then in process_archs() if load_archs_libraries() and
  load_dependent_libraries() return FALSE it calls to setup the symbolic info,
  build a new symbol table and swap the symbol table for output before
  returning.
 
  The routines setup_symbolic_info() and build_new_symbol_table() both had a
  new boolean prameter missing_arch.  And if missing_arch is passed as TRUE it
  just setups up the info or builds the new symbol table without updating the
  prebinding info.

- Added the -f flag to ranlib so that it warns when it creates a fat archive
  that ar(1) will not be able to operate on.  This is used by ar(1) with the
  -s option when it runs ranlib. Radar bug #2814831.
- Changed the use of N_WEAK_SYM to N_WEAK_REF in nm.c and redo_prebinding.c.
- Changed the Makefile to not use the -dependency-file with gcc as well as
  mwccppc.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-395 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding that was checking for symbols being overridden
  where it should have ignored two-level namespace libraries. Added checks in
  check_dylibs_for_definition() and check_dylibs_for_reference().

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-394 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding that should not have been checking for symbols
  being overridden in two-level namespace images.  The change was in
  process_arch() adding a check before the call to
  check_for_dylib_override_symbols().
- Changed strip to strip coalesced symbols that are not used with an indirect
  symbol table entry by default. Radar bug #2689894.
- Updated redo_prebinding to support weak linking. Radar bug #2803414.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-393 release):
- Changed nm(1)'s -m option to print "weak external" for symbols with the
  N_WEAK_SYM bit set.
- Made the changes to support the LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB varient of the
  LC_LOAD_DYLIB load command.  The following files were effected check_hints.c,
  install_name_tool.c, nm.c, redo_prebinding.c and segedit.c.

  Note: the changes to redo_prebinding.c to support redoing the prebinding when
  a weak library is missing or a weak symbol is missing is not done yet.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-392 release):
- Changed the calls to ofile_process() in size.c, strings.c, nm.c and
  kern_tool.c to pass TRUE for the new use_member_syntax parameter.  Radar bug
  #2730127.
- Changed the calls to ofile_process() in checksyms.c, cmpdylib.c,
  seg_addr_table.c and check_dylib.c to pass FALSE for the new use_member_syntax
  parameter.  Radar bug #2730127.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-390 release):
- Added the command install_name_tool(1).
- Fixed some bugs in the update_load_commands() routine of redo_prebinding.c .
  The first was the missing check of the section flags against S_ZEROFILL when
  determining the low_fileoff.  The others where in not resetting all of the
  pointers into the load_commands at the end of the routine.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-389 release):
- Updated the inout.c example tool to work correctly with all the tables of
  a dynamic library.
- Added the -prebind_all_twolevel_modules and the -headerpad_max_install_names
  options to libtool.
- Fixed a bug with the checking of the LIBRARY_ORDINAL in redo_prebinding that
  was causing a crash when SELF_LIBRARY_ORDINAL (0) was used in a malformed
  executable.  Radar bug #2787021.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-387 release):
- Changed check_dylib to not check the -install_name argument of the dylib if
  the dylib starts with @executable_path.
- Added the -seg_addr_table_filename <file_system_path> option to libtool,
  redo_prebinding, checksyms and check_dylib.  For check_dylib this flag is
  required.
- Fixed a grammatical error in redo_prebinding.c where "overridden" should have
  been used where "overridded" was used.   Radar bug #2764926.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-386 release):
- Changed the breakout() calls in strip.c, indr.c and seg_hack.c to pass FALSE
  as the value for the new calculate_input_prebind_cksum parameter and always
  set the prebind checksum to zero (if any) on output.
- Added the -z option to redo_prebinding(1) to zero out the prebind check sum.
- Changed all the breakout() calls in redo_prebinding.c to pass the appropate
  value for the new calculate_input_prebind_cksum parameter.

Changes for the 5.10 release (the cctools-385 release):
- Fixed a bug in the parsing of the -segs_read_only_addr and
  -segs_read_write_addr options to seg_addr_table.c that was missing a leading
  '-'.
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) to add the -seg_addr_table option to allow it to
  relocate a dynamic library to a new prefered address.  Many changes to the
  code were made to support this. Radar bug #2575205 and #2729976.

  Added the routine object_file_type().

  Added the only_if_needed boolean parameter to the redo_prebinding(3) library.

  Changed the return type of the redo_prebinding(3) library API to be an enum.

  Removed the comment about the slide_to_address parameter of the
  redo_prebinding(3) library API not being supported.

  Added the expected_address parameter to the needs_redo_prebinding(3) library
  API.

  Changed libredo_prebinding.a from an object file to an archive.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-380 release):
- Added the -twolevel_namespace_hints option to libtool.  Radar bug #2735266.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-379 release):
- Fixed pagestuff(1) to know about the hints table.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-372 release):
- Picked up the changes to seg_addr_table(1) for the new -update_overlaps
  option.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-371 release):
- Fixed "uptodate" to be "up to date" in redo_prebinding.c.  Radar bug #2711451.
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) that was not testing the value of arch_hints
  for NULL before using it in build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c
  before using it.  So for images without hints it would crash.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-370 release):
- Added support for updating the hints table to redo_prebinding.

  Changed swap_arch_for_output() for swapping hints on output.

  Change build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c to also update
  the hints table with its call to lookup_symbol().  Changed the various
  lookup_symbol*() routines to take a pointer to a isub_image and itoc to
  fill in if not NULL.

  Changed build_new_symbol_table() to account for hints in the sym_info_size.

  Added variables arch_hints and arch_nhints to redo_prebinding.c and cleared
  them in reset_statics() and set and swapped them in setup_symbolic_info().

- Changed strip_object() in strip.c to set the object's output_hints field and
  to reset the object's hints_cmd->offset field.  Also to adjust the
  input_sym_info_size and output_sym_info_size fields with the size of the
  hints.
- Changed build_new_symbol_table() in redo_prebinding.c to know about the
  hints table as in strip above.
- Changed translate_dylib() in indr.c to know about INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL and
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS.  And to know about prebound undefined symbols (N_PBUD).
  Also made the same changes as in strip noted above for hints.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-369.3 release):
- Fixed a bug in check_symbolic_info_tables() in redo_prebinding.c in its
  checking for bad LIBRARY_ORDINAL that needed to make sure the symbol was not
  a N_STAB before checking it.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-369 release):
- Fixed redo_prebinding which had the same problem as dyld that was fixed in
  cctools-366 with undefined symbol references from two-level images where
  the definition of the symbol is in a sub-framework of a flat namespace
  umbrella framework that would come up undefined.   The fixes were in
  load_archs_libraries() and load_dependent_libraries() for counting the
  dependent libraries no longer being conditional on the image being
  MH_TWOLEVEL.  And in load_dependent_libraries() so the call to
  setup_sub_images() is also longer conditional on if the image is MH_TWOLEVEL.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-367 release):
- Added support for sub-libraries like sub-umbrellas to redo_prebinding.
  Radar bug #2697458.

  Added the following field to the lib struct:
    char *library_name; 
  and changed the of the following field from umbrella_name_size to:
    unsigned long name_size;    
  for use both by umbrella_name and library_name.  The code was changed to use
  the new field name.

  Changed load_archs_libraries() and load_library() to set the library_name
  field from the return value of guess_short_name().

  Changed print_two_level_info() to print the library_name in the various lists.

  Changed setup_sub_images()'s header comments to include sub-libraries and
  added code to deal with sub-libraries like sub-umbrellas.
- Added the -sub_library flag to libtool.  Radar bug #2697458.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-363 release):
- Changed libtool so that if -arch_only is specified with a specific cpusubtype
  other than the family cpusubtype it does not use -force_cpusubtype_ALL and
  passes the -arch_only argument to ld(1) as the -arch flag so that the output
  is to be tagged with that cpusubtype.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-362 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding.c in main() where the mask it uses to get
  the mode from the stat mode should be 07777 not 06777 so the sticky bit
  gets set.
- Added progname to file.c as the changes to libstuff needs it (this is the
  Openstep version of file).
- Fixed the same bug in load_dependent_libraries() as in dyld in
  redo_prebinding.c that was only calling setup_umbrella_images() if the library
  was a MH_TWOLEVEL.  This needed to call setup_umbrella_images() for all
  libraries as it is possible that a sub-framework of an umbrella library is
  flat and the umbrella library is two-level.  In that case other images could
  have two-level namespace references recorded to the umbrella library for
  symbols defined in the flat sub-framework.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-360 release):
- Added the -e option to redo_prebinding(1) to take the executable_path.
- Changed the code in redo_prebinding to be ifdef'ed with LIBRARY_API for the
  API in Radar bug #2604014.

Changes for the 5.9 release (the cctools-359 release):
- Changed libtool(1) to pass -multiply_defined <treatment> to the linker.
- Made a great number of changes to redo_prebinding(1) so it would support
  two-level namespace images.
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) that would overwrite the output_file with
  a partially written file if the filesystem fills up.  Radar bug #2639352.
- Added code in nm.c to deal with the library ordinal being EXECUTABLE_ORDINAL.
- Changed checksyms(1) to open the default segment address table if none is
  specified via a -seg_addr_table argument.
- Added -Wno-long-double to shutup the compiler for
  <architecture/m88k/fp_regs.h>.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-357 release):
- Added support for the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_7450 in lipo.c. Radar bug #2599869.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(1) when the -update option was used that it
  did not preserve the non-zero addresses in the table.  Instead it changed the
  non-zero entries to the values in the libraries were built with.  Radar bug
  #2575214.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-356 release):
- Changed the algorithm in seg_addr_table(1) for split libraries to add in the
  rounding factor (0x10000) before calling round().

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-355 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip that needed to save local symbols that were private
  extern symbols that were in COALESCED sections.  Radar bug #2584111.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-354 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1) when using -filelist that did not allocate the
  correct amount of memory due to a '*' needing to be a '+' on lines 388 and
  on 390.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-352 release):
- Fixed yet another bug with nmedit(1) that did not set the fields nlocalsym and
  nextdefsym to zero before incrementing them.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-351 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit(1) that did not swap the correct module table.
- Fixed a bug with nm(1) dealing with a dynamic library that had bad iextdefsym
  or nextdefsym fields of a dylib_module which caused it to crash.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-350 release):
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(1) where the -disablewarnings flag did not
  disable the split overlap messages.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-349 release):
- Added passing -Y through from libtool to ld.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-348 release):
- Changed nmedit to remove duplicate names in the -s file so it does not
  later complain that a symbol did not appear in the input file.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-347 release):
- Fixed a bug in the handing of -final_output on the command line of libtool.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-346 release):
- Added the -final_output flag to libtool to pass along to ld(1).

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-345 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding -c so that it also checks the installed dynamic
  library against the file it is running against for the correct time
  stamp.  Radar bug #2541232.
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding that did not correctly exit when an
  executable's dependent libraries were out of date.  Radar bug #2544407.
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding that did not correctly redo the relocation
  for split libraries as it was not based on the -seg_read_write_address as it
  should have been for split libraries.  Radar bug #2544599.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(1) that caused it to crash as it was doing
  a memset on a malloc()'ed memory larger than was allocated.  Also fixed
  a bug that was not allocating enough layout_info structs. Radar bug #2540744.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-344 release):
- Changed nm(1) -m to print the name of the libraries undefined symbols are
  bound from when MH_TWOLEVEL is in the header.  Radar bug #2538835.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-342 release):
- Added parsing the -flatname_space and -twolevel_namespace options and 
  -allowable_client option to libtool(1).  Radar bug #2533649.
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) in its checking of sorted flat libraries for
  overlaps so that when checking the next flat address to be assigned it checks
  that the next address is also greater than the start of the as well as less
  than the end of the region and that the region is not a fixed region.
  Radar bug #2531831.

Changes for the 5.8 release (the cctools-341 release):
- Changed setup_symbol_list() in strip.c to allocate and stuff in an extra
  newline in the symbol list file so that files that end without a new line
  work.  Radar bug #2520711.
- Added the tool seg_hack to change the names of Mach-O segments for use by KLD.
  Radar bug #2523649.
- Changed nmedit to not change global coalesced symbols into statics and changed
  strip not not strip global coalesced symbols.  Radar bug #2503670.
  Also made a fix to this to because if a coalesced symbol were listed in the
  -s file it complained that the symbol was not in the input.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-337 release):
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) to use 0x70000000 as the default segs_read_only_addr
  and 0x80000000 as the seg_read_write_addr.  Also added two entries in
  sorted_flat_layout_info so that next_flat_seg1addr() will step over these
  areas.  Radar bug #2496843.
- Added a check in edit_symtab() in strip.c (for nmedit) that checks to see
  that the N_FUN name is not NULL.  This prevents a error message about a
  missing ':' in the stab name of a N_FUN when the name is NULL.  The compiler
  emits this as the end of the function stab.  Radar bug #2495413.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-336 release):
- Added code in libtool.c that did not place N_SECT symbols marked with the
  attribute NO_TOC into the table of contents.  Radar bug #2494286.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-334 release):
- Changed checksyms(l) to not generate an error if a segment address table is
  used and the library is not found in it.  As the B&I tools will add it
  automaticly.  Also removed all checks for paths and use guess_short_name().
  Also changed guess_short_name()'s has_suffix argument to return a pointer
  to the suffix so checksyms could check for "_debug".  This effected
  seg_addr_table(l)'s and ld(1)'s guess_short_name() call too.  Radar bug
  #2490411.
- Changed seg_addr_table(l) to not use the factor for allocating the size of
  split libraries.  Also added some checking so that only the first 128meg of
  a 256meg split segment is allocated.  Radar bug #2490413.
- Added the -run_init_lazily flag to libtool. Radar bug #2490396.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-333 release):
- Fixed a bug introduced with the changes to strip.c to allow nmedit to work
  on shared libraries.  It produced bad output files for fat files as it was
  free()'ing data structures to be written out.  Radar bug #2484851.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-332 release):
- Added the -disablewarnings flag to seg_addr_table(1).  This flag is also
  passed to the various routines used in libstuff (Radar bug #2482327).
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(1) where -update did not ignore the fixed and
  next entries which caused address assigned for -update to be very messed up
  (Radar bug #2482327).
- Major changes to strip.c to allow nmedit to work on dynamic shared libraries.
  Also fixes to nmedit so that the symbol table was in the right order after
  symbols were change to statics.  Other changes in dyld and ld are also needed
  for this change (Radar bug #2420307).

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-330 release):
- Changed the call to netname_look_up() in check_for_ProjectBuilder() in
  libtool.c to bootstrap_look_up() when __OPENSTEP__ and
  __GONZO_BUNSEN_BEAKER__ is not defined (Radar bug #2473864).

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-329 release):
- Fixed a bug in the command line parsing of the strings command where if you
  gave it any argument it would think there were also files listed on the
  command line so it would never parse standard input if "strings -4 < file"
  was used (Radar bug #2459126).
- Added code in seg_addr_table.c to not assign addresses over the maximum
  intel user space address.  Radar bug #2418080.
- Removed the core.c file from this directory since the new API to create a
  task from a core file was added.  Radar bug #2155790.
- Changed libtool to pass -whatsloaded to ld(1).  Radar bug #2469803.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table when in update mode an new flat entry with a
  zero address in the table (and a non-matching address in the file) is to be
  updated and there are existing entries with the same short name.  To solve
  this a new field current_entry was added to the layout_info struct for
  sizes_and_addresses() to use.  It is set to the current seg_addr_table entry
  before calling ofile_process() which will call sizes_and_addresses().  Then
  sizes_and_addresses() can tell if the current entry has a zero address not to
  generate the warning message about the ofile not having the correct seg1addr.
  Radar bug #2469876.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table in sizes_and_addresses() where it was updating
  the layout_info->seg1addr after it printed an error message that the seg1addr
  did not match.  That error message also did not print the architecture.  This
  problem then caused a later error message to think that the original file had
  the wrong address.  Radar bug #2469876.
- Fixed a bug in libtool/ranlib that did not deal with zero length archive
  members that had long names and used 4.4BSD extended format #1.  The code in
  libtool in two places was subtracting the size of the name from the member
  size which had already been done by the ofile routines.  Radar bug #2460604.
- Changed checksyms(l) to allow debug symbols in libraries and frameworks with
  _debug suffixes.  Radar bug #2469760.
- Changed strip.c to allow '\r' as well as '\n' in the strip list file.  Radar
  bug #2458346.

Changes for the 5.7 release (the cctools-327 release):
- Changed checksyms(l) to used "/AppleInternal" going forward and only use
  "/Local" when __GONZO_BUNSEN_BEAKER__ is defined for older builds (DP3, PR2,
  etc).

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-324 release):
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(l) so that it checks all entries in the table
  against all other entries for overlaps.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(l) so that -checkonly does not check entries
  with 0 addresses.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(l) in its next_flat_seg1addr() not correctly
  stepping over the fixed regions.
- Fixed a bug in seg_addr_table(l) in reporting the correct line in checking
  for overlap with fixes regions (the have the same "install_name") so the new
  routine search_seg_addr_table_for_fixed() was added.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-323 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) that did not correctly mark the module with
  the shared library initialization routine as linked in cases where the module
  was not directly referenced.  This could cause the shared library
  initialization routine not to be called.  Radar bug #2450931.
- Added passing -arch_errors_fatal from libtool(1) to ld(1).
- Changed the check_install_name(l) tool to be check_dylib(l) to preform
  a series of checks on a dynamic library as per B&I's request.
- Changed seg_addr_table(1) to not fall back an try to open the install_name
  if a -release option was specified.  As this is the way B&I intends to use
  the tool.  Also added the -checkonly option.
- Removed the ifdef's that avoided calling find_dylib_in_root() as the bug
  in there that was missing an fts_close() is fixed.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-322 release):
- Added ifdef'ed for __SPACE__ and created a macro SYSTEM_LIBRARY in checksyms.c
  in preparation for the directory changes. /System/Library changing to
  /MacOSX/System.
- Created the check_install_name(l) tool for B&I to check the a dynamic library
  is installed in its $(DSTROOT) in its -install_name.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-321 release):
- Picked up Chris Kane's changes to checksyms(l) to not check for objcunique
  sections.  Radar bug #2448096.
- Added overlap checking to seg_addr_table(l) and support for fixed regions.
  Currently there are bugs in fts(3) so its used is ifdef'ed out with
  ifdef NO_BUGS_IN_FTS which means that the DSTROOT file is searched for but
  not the SYMROOT file.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-320 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool to not passing -arch_multiple when fat files are in the
  input files to ld when -arch_only is passed to libtool.
- Added the -dylib_file option to libtool.
- Added the -umbrella option to libtool.  Radar bug #2443212.

Changes for the 5.6 release (the cctools-319 release):
- Removed the check for execute bits in a dynamic library in checksyms(l).
- Added the -seg_addr_table option and the LD_SEG_ADDR_TABLE environment
  variables as alternate ways to check the address of shared libraries in
  checksyms(l).
- Created the seg_addr_table(1) program to layout and update a segment address
  table for use when building dynamic libraries.

Changes for the 5.5 release (the cctools-315 release):
- Removed the installing of the bom file as this has not been used since
  NeXTstep 2.1.

Changes for the 5.5 release (the cctools-314 release):
- Changed where nmedit gets installed from /usr/local/bin to /usr/bin.  Radar
  bug #2396595.

Changes for the 5.5 release (the cctools-310 release):
- Added passing the -Sn, -Si, -S, -X flags from libtool to ld.

Changes for the 5.5 release (the cctools-307 release):
- Added two private options for nm. -b name and -iN to print the N_BINCL symbols
  from the 'name' include file starting at index N not printing the file#'s.
  This was used to track down differences in stabs.  Radar bug #2410704.
- Fixed a bug in nmedit(l) (and strip(1)) that did not process the -arch flags
  as arch family flags.  Radar bug #2405763.
- Added the the STAB types: N_BNSYM, N_ENSYM, N_BINCL, N_EINCL and N_EXCL to
  the table in nm for printing. Radar bug #2410704.
- Added support for the CPU_SUBTYPE_POWERPC_7400 in lipo.c.  Radar bug #2397523.

Changes for the 5.4 release (the cctools-303 release):
- Changed libtool so that the message that about creating a library with an
  empty table of contents is calling warning() not error() as it is a warning
  message.  Also added "define global symbols" to the end of the message "(no
  object file members in the library define global symbols)".
- Changed a message in checksyms(l) to use "Build & Integration" and not
  "release control".  Radar bug #2377929.

Changes the 5.4 release (the cctools-300 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit(1) when using -R and processing more than one
  architecture it printed an error stating "more than one symbol" for a symbol
  listed in the -R file appeared in the input file.  Radar bug #2367598.
- Changed nmedit(l) to strip all arch's when no -arch flags are specified to
  match the behavoir of strip(1).  Radar bug #2367598.
- Added the "-init <symbol_name>" argument to libtool to be passed through to
  ld(1) for the dynamic shared library initialization routine symbol

Changes the 5.4 release (the cctools-296 release):
- Added the -v (verification flag) to checksyms to print out a single line for
  each type of error checksyms finds.  Also added hacks #ifdef'ed
  ALLOW_MACOSX_PR1_PATHS to allow all MacOS X PR1 paths.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-292 release):
- Added some braces to get rid of the warning message from the egcs compiler
  "warning: suggest explicit braces to avoid ambiguous `else'".  This was done
  to cmpdylib.c .
- Changed the return type of main() in redo_prebinding.c, pagestuff.c,
  dylib_pcsampler.c, cmpdylib.c, kern_tool.c, segedit.c, strip.c, indr.c,
  checksyms.c, libtool.c, nm.c, strings.c, size.c and lipo.c from void to int to
  remove a warning from the egcs compiler.  Also changed the exit() calls at the
  end to return()'s.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-290 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit in the code that was added to support the -p flag.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-289 release):
- Added the -p flag to nmedit to change symbols into private externs rather
  than static.

Changes the 5.3 release (the cctools-288 release):
- Changed nmedit(l) to change the indirect symbol table entries for global
  symbols it makes static.  The indirect symbols are changed to
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL or INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS.  This problem showed up in
  using nmedit for the work around with the egcs compiler and C++ RTTI common
  data in a dynamic shared library.
- Added passing -whyload through libtool to ld.
- Changed some type and casts to make strip.c compile with the MetroWerks
  compiler.
- Changed the message printed when the environment variable RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES
  is set from: "RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES archive_name" to: "[Logging for Build &
  Integration] Used static archive: archive_name".  Radar bug #2310273.

Changes for the the 5.3 release (the cctools-285 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool(1) that was not using NEXT_ROOT when set to expand
  -l flags.
- Added printing a line like "RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES archive_name", where
  archive_name is a archive being put into the output of libtool(1) -static.
  This is done when the environment variable RC_TRACE_ARCHIVES is set.
  Radar bug #2303376.
- Removed the #ifdef NeXT from atom.c .
- Fixed a bug in ranlib (aka libtool) where when dealing with multiple symbols
  defined in the same members, it trys to only print each table of contents
  entry once by marking the symbol by changing the sign on the ran_off field.
  There were two missing casts on two comparisons because the ran_off is
  unsigned.
- Fixed a bug in strip in strip_symtab() where when it was walking the reference
  table looking for symbols not yet listed as saved it would added them to the
  changes[] array without testing to see it it already added them to the
  changes[] array.  This happens because a symbol may be referenced by more the
  one module in dynamic shared library.  This showed up when the CoreGraphics
  framework was stripped with the -s option and undefined symbols were not
  expicitedly listed.  This caused the code in strip to allocate more new
  undefined symbols maps than it filled it.  The extra maps were garbage and
  caused the module table in the CoreGraphics to be updated wrong which caused
  the static linker to generate the malformed object error:
	ilocalsym field plus nlocalsym field of module table entry 1 past the
	end of the symbol table

Changes for the 5.3 release, MacOS X bring up (the cctools-282 release):
- Added libtool to the Metrowerks source target.
- Changed host_self() and task_self() to mach_host_self() and mach_task_self()
  for MacOS X.  Also included "stuff/openstep_mach.h" for macros to allow it
  to still build on Openstep.  Also changed ifdef's __SLICK__ to __OPENSTEP__.
- Ifdef'ed __MACH30__ make.defs for mach_port_t vs mach_port.  Also ifdef'ed out
  netname_look_up() call and #include <servers/netname.h> for __MACH30__ in
  libtool.c (these are not yet in the SDK).
- Changed the Makefile to allow for RC_OS=macos for MacOS X builds.
- Added a few casts in places to get it to compile with the MetroWerks compiler
  without -relax_pointers.
- Changed the Makefile to nolonger compile checksyms with -static.  When linking
  with -static the MetroWerks compiler uses -framework System which is not
  leagal with ld(1) and -static.
- Changed arch_flag_processed = FALSE; to arch_flag_processed = NULL; in
  translate_input() in indr.c so it would compile with the MetroWerks compiler.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-281 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding to exit with a error code of 3 if the dependent
  libraries are out of date.  Radar bug #2259447.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-280 release):
- Changed libtool to pass the -F and -L flags to objcunique.  Radar bug #2257931.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-276 release):
- The fix in cctools-275 was using the variable "changes" after it was free'ed.
  Move the free() past the last use.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-275 release):
- Made a fix to strip when stripping a dynamic shared library.  If a symbol is
  to be stripped and it was defined in a module and also referenced in another
  module, it was correctly changed to an undefined symbol but incorrecly left
  in the table of contents. Radar bug #2239280.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-274 release):
- Added the -R option to nmedit to provide a list of symbols to turn into 
  static symbols.  If -R is specified and no -s is specified all symbols except
  those in the -R file are "saved" and not turned into static symbols.
  Radar bug #2235926.
- Added the -R option to strip to provide a list of symbols to strip.  Also
  changed the list of symbols to allow comment lines starting with '#' and to
  trim leading and trailing blanks.  Radar bug #2235926.
- Removed uses of CPU_SUBTYPE_586SX in lipo.c and added support for the new
  intel subtypes. Radar bug #2231830.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-271 release):
- Fixed it so libtool -static would not warn about -L and -l flags as these
  are valid flags with -static.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-269 release):
- Backed off checking libtool -dynamic and -static flags as hard errors to
  allow builds to work.

Changes for the 5.2 release (the cctools-267 release):
- The -b flag for checksyms(l) is now the default to check for prebinding and
  read_only_relocs.  Radar bug #2227469.
- Fixed a bug in nm(1) with -o that did not print a ':' after the module name
  and before the symbol name.  Radar bug #2227852.
- Fixed a bug in libtool that incorrectly put -framework flags in ld flags and
  not treat it like a file.  This caused -l and -framework to get out of order.
  Radar bug #2227863.
- Added the core program to test dyld debug intefaces from a core file.  This
  program is not built as part of the install target.  It requires a
  libdyld/debug.c compiled with -DCORE.
- Added code to checksyms to allow blank lines in the dylib table.  Radar bug
  #2227872.
- Added all the suport needed for the 4.4BSD extended format #1 to nm, size,
  strip, indr, inout, redo_prebinding, checksyms and lipo.  Radar bug #1670513.
- Added the -L and -T flags to libtools and ranlib to support or truncate long
  archive names.  Added all the suport needed for the 4.4BSD extended format #1
  for long names.  The default is now -L (use long names).  Radar bug #1670513.
- Make libtool -static treat flags for -dynamic as errors.  Also cleaned up
  and corrected other flag checking.  Radar bug #2227885.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-261 release):
- Updated lipo's printing of supported POWERPC subtypes. Radar bug #2213821.
- Fixed a bug in link_library_module() in redo_prebinding.c that did not check
  if the symbol found that might be multiply defined was in a module that was
  not in the UNLINKED state before saying it was multiply defined.
  Radar bug #2213249.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-260 release):
- Added -c to all the install commands in the Makefile.
- Added /Local/Library/Frameworks as a conventional path for frameworks.
- Changed "it's" to "its" in checksyms messages.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-258 release):
- Changed checksyms to know about /usr/lib/java again.  There are two sets of
  java dylibs and this path should have not been removed.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-257 release):
- Changed checksyms to reflect the new Java paths.  Previously was /usr/lib/java
  now is /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Libraries .

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-256 release):
- Added /usr/lib/java as a conventional path for libraries in checksyms.
  Radar bug #2005914.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-253 release):
- Made checksyms check prebinding, read-only relocs and objcunique.  Currently
  enabled only when -b is specified.
- Fixed a bug in checksyms that was not correctly checking for N_FUN stabs.
- Changed the Makefile to only create the needed dst directories.
- Changed checksyms to match the new directory layout for Preimer.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-249 release):
- Added the ppc relocation to redo_prebinding.
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in update_load_commands() when an executable
  had LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB commands for dylibs that it did not have LC_LOAD_DYLIB
  commands (this was run into because of a bug in ld with $NEXT_ROOT set).  The
  fix is to toss all LC_PREBOUND_DYLIB except the ones that have matching
  LC_LOAD_DYLIB commands.
- Changed redo_prebinding and libtool to look for objcunique in /usr/bin rather
  in /bin.
- Fixed a bug where nm -n on Rhapsody did not sort correctly.  The bug was in
  the compare function that was returning 1 or 0 for less and greater when it
  should have been 1 or -1.

Changes for the 5.1 release (the cctools-247 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool.c in check_sort_ranlibs() where the unsigned value
  on lin 1952 was being checked for < 0.  A cast to int was added.
- Added MKDIRS if code to the Makefile to build native on Rhapsody.
- Changed the Makefile to use gnutar instead of tar because it works on Rhapsody
  where tar does not.
- Changed the Makefile to install non-local binaries in /usr/bin for RC_OS
  teflon and in /bin for RC_OS nextstep (Radar 1673496).
- Changed the code ifdef __TEFLON__ to ifndef __SLICK__ (where __TEFLON__ will
  nolonger be defined for Rhapsody builds) so the default builds will be native
  Rhapsody builds.  The changes were to file.c, libtool.c, lipo.c and segedit.c.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-245 release):
- Fixed symbolic links from /usr/bin/strip   to ../../bin/strip
		       from /usr/bin/strings to ../../bin/strings
		       from /usr/bin/size    to ../../bin/size
		       from /usr/bin/nm      to ../../bin/nm
  (Radar 1672088).

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-243 release):
- Added symbolic links from /usr/bin/strip   to $(DSTROOT)/bin/strip
		       from /usr/bin/strings to $(DSTROOT)/bin/strings
		       from /usr/bin/size    to $(DSTROOT)/bin/size
		       from /usr/bin/nm      to $(DSTROOT)/bin/nm
  (Radar 1672088).

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-240 release):
- Changed so that atom only gets installed for OS=nextstep because it used the
  encumbered <gnu/a.out.h>.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-235 release):
- Added an ifdef(ppc) in four places to atom.c to remove some warnings.
- Replace the comments with the OpenBSD comments in nm.c, size.c and strings.c.
- Removed building ar and file when $(RC_OS) is "teflon".  These commands will
  are in there own directories one level up based on the OpenBSD versions.

Changes for the 5.0 release (the cctools-224 release):
- Changed including <ranlib.h> to <mach-o/ranlib.h> which uses unsigned long
  instead of off_t (64 bits on Teflon).

Changes for the 5.0 release (cctools-216 release):
- Changed building checksyms to link staticly.  Still does not build in Teflon
  as it needs -lc_static which is currently missing.

Changes for the 5.0 release (cctools-215 release):
- Made a hack in the Makefile to not build checksyms for teflon because it needs
  -lsys because RC wants it built to run on 3.3 machines.

Changes for the 4.2 and 5.0 releases (cctools-213 and cctools-209.4  release):
- Added ignoring -pg to libtool.

Changes for the 5.0 release (cctools-210 release):
- Changed m98k to ppc.

Changes for the 4.2 and 4.1 patch releases (cctools-207 release):
- Added -noall_load and -all_load to libtool.  The compiler driver with the
  option -dynamiclib will call libtool with the -noall_load option by default.
  This is to avoid pulling all of libcc_dynamic.a in which can't be done in
  all cases as it could produce a undefined reference to __DTOR_LIST__.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-202 release):
- Changed libtool to ignore -g[gdb,codeview,stab][number] flags (bug #67597).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-199 release):
- Fixed a problem in redo_prebinding(1) with setting the file's owner and group
  introduced in cctools-196 (bug #65646).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-197 release):
- Added -image_base flag to libtool as synonym for -seg1addr (bug #65273).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-196 release):
- Fixed a problem in redo_prebinding(1) which was not setting the file's owner
  and group (bug #65137).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-192 release):
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) to only run /bin/objcunique when it redoes the
  prebinding.  This was causing /bin/objcunique to fail when run on non-Mach-O
  files in checking modes (bug #63509).
- Changed redo_prebinding(1) to call chmod(2) to set back the original modes so
  setuid and setgid bits get set (bug #63448).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-188 release):
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding where it did not correctly swap the fat files
  it created.  The call to swap_arch_for_output() was done only once and not
  once per architecture in the fat file (bug #62267).
- Fixed a bug in lipo -extract where it would not extract anything except the
  first architecture in the fat file (bug #62145).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-187 release):
- Added a check to checksyms to make sure dynamic libraries have some execute
  bits set (bug #61511).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in the function update_load_commands() when
  the load commands had to be rewritten the pointers to the load commands for
  the symtab and dysymtab commands needed to be reset (bug #61735).
- Fixed the spelling of "compatibility" (was "compaiblity") in cmpdylib error
  message (bug #61697).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding in the function build_new_symbol_table() where
	    arch_nmodtab * sizeof(struct dylib_module *) +
  should have been:
	    arch_nmodtab * sizeof(struct dylib_module) +
  That is the size of the struct not the size of a pointer (bug #61735).
- Changed calling /bin/objcunique to always pass -prebind in redo_prebinding
  and libtool (bug #61735).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-186 release):
- Added passing "-r root_dir" to /bin/objcunique in redo_prebinding.
- Removed the built in table to checksyms and use ~rc/Data/DylibTable by default
  (bug #61427).
- Fixed a bug in nm(1) with the undocumented value difference option (-v) which
  has to be used with -n and -s.  The problem was the test for no selected
  symbols needed to be moved to the outer if statement (bug #61341).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-185 release):
- Added running /bin/objcunique if -prebind or LD_PREBIND is set in libtool
  (bug #61230).
- Fixed a bug in checksyms as it parsed out "/usr/lib" before
  "/usr/lib/NextPrinter" so it thought the name of the libFaxD library was 
  "NextPrinter/libFaxD" not "libFaxD" as it should have been (bug #61231).
- Added table entries to checksyms for (bug #61231):
    { 0x1f000000, "InterfaceBuilder" },
    { 0x20000000, "AppTest" },
    { 0x21000000, "libRK" },
    { 0x22000000, "libRKC" },
    { 0x23000000, "libcanna" },
- Added the directory  "/usr/canna/dylib" for libRK, libRKC, and libcanna
  to checksyms (bug #61231).
- Made a hack to checksyms(l) that allows MH_DYLIB's and MH_FVMLIB's to have
  stabs as long as it does not have N_FUN symbols (stabs for functions)
  (bug #61231).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) which did not deal with indrect symbols
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL which were local symbols that were striped (bug #61232).
- Fixed a bug in redo_prebinding(1) which did not return the correct status
  if an input file was mallformed and fatal_arch() was called from checkout()
  or breakout().  The fix was to copy in the fatal_arch.c code and change
  the exit() call in fatal_arch to switch off check_for_non_prebound (-p) and
  exit(0) or exit(2) otherwise (bug #61232).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-183 release):
- Added the -dylib_table argument to checksyms.
- Changed checksyms to default to arch all if no -arch's are specified.
- Finished the redo_prebinding command and added it to cctools (bug #60110).
- Added an entry in the checksyms table for EOControl at address 0x1e000000.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-182 release):
- Added an entry in the checksyms table for libFaxD at address 0x1d000000.
  Added the directory /usr/lib/NextPrinter/ to be an allowed path.
- Added an entry in the checksyms table for libMallocDebug at address 0.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-181 release):
- Fixed a typo in the Makefile that made pagestuff from lipo.private.o
  (bug #59715).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-176 release):
- Fixed a bug in checksyms that did not deal with profile suffixed dylibs.
  Also added entries in the table for Message and libkeymap (bug #)
- Fixed a bug in strip in stripping objects with prebound undefined symbols
  (bug #58405).

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-175 release):
- Changed the Makefile to ld -r builds because private externs were causing
  prebinding to fail because of overlap.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-173 release):
- Added passing -arch_multiple to ld from libtool when running for more than
  one architecture.  Also always pass -arch flag because even if the objects
  are thin dylib1.o maybe fat or of a different architecture.
- Updated strip to know about prebound undefined symbols so it would strip
  objects with such symbols correctly.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-172 release):
- Fixed a bug in nm that was not selecting prebound undefined symbols as
  undefined symbols when -u was used.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-168 release):
- Wrote the program pagestuff to replace pageSymbols.
- Fixed a typo in lipo "architecure" changed to "architecture" (bug #55959).
- Change the version numbers of dynamic library to the form X[.Y[.Z]] to match
  how next does versioning of it's projects.  This effected libtool(1), ld(1),
  otool(1), dyld, libstuff(version_number.c) and man pages for ld and libtool
  bug #55627).  In here the changes were in libtool.c .

Changes for the 4.0 PR1 release (the cctools-166.9 and cctools-168 releases):
- Checksyms by default should have been non-verbose.  The errors messages in
  check_dylib() should have only been produced when the -d (detail) flag was
  on (bug #55648).

Changes for the 4.0 PR1 release (the cctools-166.8 and cctools-168 releases):
- Updated checksyms to know about NIInterface, EOAccess, EOInterface, NeXTApps
  and NIAccess.  As well as changed the /LocalLibrary/Frameworks/ path to
  /NextLibrary/PrivateFrameworks/ (bug #55414).  Also now build this -static.
- Fixed bug #55337 in libtool(1) that parsed -read_only_relocs as
  -read-only-relocs.
- Fixed bug #55334 in checksyms(l) which did not check for the Versions
  directory correctly because of a copy and paste error.  Also all dylib errors
  are now fatal.

Changes for the 4.0 release (cctools-167 release):
- Fixed bug #53766 in file(1) which incorrectly reported some fat files
  malformed.  The bug was in type_buf() where it was looping the load commands
  checking for non-stripped and the test to end the loop if looking past the
  end of the buffer was in the wrong place.  This caused the varaible ifile to
  get trashed when the symbol_table command was swapped and then the reads on
  that file descriptor failed.

Changes for the 4.0 PR1 release (the cctools-166.1 and cctools-167 releases):
- Fixed a bug in libtool for creating static libraries that did not set the
  toc time and mod time based on the time of the file system that the library
  was created on.  To do this it involved changing create_library() to record
  where the ar_date's of the toc archive headers were and rewriting them after
  the file was closed when it is first created using the mod time from the file
  system (bug #52612).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-165 release):
- Added passing -read-only-relocs through from libtool to ld.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-164 release):
- Fixed a bug in nm when -o is used on a dynamic library it did not print the
  name of the module on the line.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-161 release):
- Added an undocumented -v flag to nm(1) to be used with -n and -s to print the
  difference of the values of symbols.
- Changed Foundation's address in checksyms to 0x18000000.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-160 release):
- Update checksyms for dylib checking:
     checks names for these forms:
	/NextLibrary/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/A/Appkit
	/LocalLibrary/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/A/Appkit
	/lib/libsys_s.A.dylib
     checks for correct addresses
     checks for compatibility and current version being set
  Currently the error condition is commented out but the checking and printing
  of the error is done.  This is waiting on the corresponding changes in the
  app Makefiles.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-158 release):
- Changed the spelling of dynamicly to dynamically in file(1) (bug #51635).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-156 release):
- Fixed a bug in indr introduced by fixing the bug in stripping objects compiled
  with -dynamic.  The indr code did not deal with -dynamic objects either and
  had to be updated with what writeout() was doing when it had an object with
  a dynamic symbol table command.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-154 release):
- Fixed a bug in checksyms that did not ignore non-object files.  The call to
  ofile_process() had process_non_objects FALSE when it should have been TRUE.
- To fixed a bug in stripping .o files compiled dynamic.  The test in
  strip_object() needed to be changed to based on if there was a dynamic symbol
  table command in the object not on if it had MH_DYLDLINK in the mach header.
  Then the starting offset of the link edit info need to be based on the lowest
  offset if there wasn't a seg link edit command.  Also a change was made in
  libstuff's writeout.c
- Wrote a first cut at cmpdylib that compares global symbols and version 
  numbers.
- Added support for stripping defined externals that appear as indirect symbol
  table entries in non-lazy pointer sections.  Strip uses the values
  INDIRECT_SYMBOL_LOCAL and INDIRECT_SYMBOL_ABS to represent the symbols that
  are defined that were stripped.  The static link editor marks defined external
  symbols in the n_desc field with REFERENCED_DYNAMICALLY and the new -r flag
  saves these symbols.  For executables that use the dynamic linker and are
  stripped with no options the default is the same as -u -r.
  saves these symbols.  For executables that use the dynamic linker 
- Picked up kern_tool.
- Added to nm(1) printing of [referenced dynamically] for REFERENCED_DYNAMICALLY
  marked external symbols with -m.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-152 release):
- Fixed a problem with indr for dylibs with symbols listed in the indr list
  that are undefined in the library.  In this case the undefined symbol does
  not get it's name changed to include an '_'.
- Added -arch_only to libtool.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-150 release):
- Added the -i option to strip(1) to ignore symbols in the -s file that are not
  in the objects being stripped.
- Added -arch_indr to indr(l).
- Added passing -F and -framework ld(1) options through for libtool -dynamic.
- Changed how libtool -dynamic handles dependent dynamic shared libraries and
  does not use the architectures contained in them to determine which
  architectures are part of output.
- Changed checksyms to allow non-stab symbols in MH_DYLDLINK files.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-149 release):
- Added passing the -filelist list[,dirname] option through to ld (bug #50779).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-148 release):
- Added -extract_family to lipo to extract all architectures in that family.
  It creates a thin or fat file (bug #47499).
- Removed the hack in checksyms to not check dylinker files now that the
  dynamic linker can be installed stripped.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-147 release):
- Fixed a bug strip -x -S when a private extern was present it was not treated
  as a global.  This worked with -x but not with both -S and -x.
- Fixed a bug in nm that did not print dylibs symbol tables of the a different
  byte sex correctly.  select_symbols() was causing double swapping if called
  more than once.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-146 release):
- Fixed a problem with the bug fix in strip that did not update relocation
  entries correctly if there are paired relocation entries.  The bug fix did
  not acount for the relocation entry being a scattered relocation entry.  This
  problem was also in indr.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-145 release):
- Fixed bugs in size, strings and checksyms when the dylib "flat" argument was
  added it was switch.
- Fixed a bug in strip when striping a dylib and a defined symbol is being
  stripped and changed into an undefined symbol the undefined symbols were not
  sorted by name.
- Fixed a TODO in strip when attempting to strip a private extern symbol in a
  dylib that had reference table entries to it.  This is treated as an error as
  the static link editor relocated to these symbols and they can't be stripped.
- Added support in indr(l) for dylibs.
- Fixed a bug in strip that did not update relocation entries correctly if there
  are paired relocation entries.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-143 release):
- Added support in nm for printing the symbols of dylib modules and a -f (flat)
  switch for getting symbols as one Mach-O file.
- Added passing the "-U symbol", "-i_defined:_indr", "-undefined warning" flags
  through libtool to ld.  Also allowed no files if flags for sections from files
  or indirect symbols are present. 

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-141 release):
- Added the ld flag -no_arch_warnings for libtool -dynamic which prevents
  warnings for files which don't have the correct architecture for the -arch
  flag.
- Fixed the spelling of "compatibility" in the compatibility_version for dylibs.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-140 release):
- Added MH_BUNDLE to file(1).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-136 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip where with no options on dyld causes it to core dump.
  The change was to strip_object() in the case of no options if the input file
  has dynamic symbol table  and local relocation entries keep those relocation
  entries on output.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-134 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip that showed up when striping a 3.2 object that did not
  have the symbols in the 3.3 order.  The problem was the relocation entries
  did not get updated correctly because the saves[] array was not updated with
  the output symbol index after the symbols were ordered.
- Fixed a bug in strip that did not update N_INDR symbols correctly because it
  did not account for the string of the indirect symbol indexed by n_value.
  This bug was introduced in cctools-127 when strip was changed to handle
  objects with the dynamic symbol table information.  So it is not in the
  cctool-119 strip that is in the 3.2hp release (bug #44817).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-133 release):
- Fixed Makefile to do the mig stuff for libtool in a read-only SRCROOT.
- Fixed a problem in strip for cross byte sex striping when the dynamic
  symbol table info is present.  In strip.c the problem was the new symbolic
  tables were not swapped to the target byte sex.  And in writeout.c in libstuff
  the problem was that parts of the headers were used after they were swapped.

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-132 release):
- Made libtool(1) with -dynamic ProjectBuilder aware and send it doing 
  messages (part of bug #40745).

Changes for the 4.0 release (the cctools-131 release):
- Changed strip to treat non-external private externs as global symbols and
  save them with -x or in the -s list file.
- Added "(was a private external)" to nm -m's printing non-external private
  externs.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-129 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip where it was free()'ing the new_* data structures it
  created.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-128 release):
- Fixed a bug strip in strip_object() where it was using object->dyst->nextrel
  without checking that object->dyst could be NULL.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-127 release):
- Major changes to strip.c to allow it to operate on objects with the dynamic
  symbol table layouts.  strip(1) now operates on MH_DYLIB files.
- nmedit(l) works with objects with the dynamic symbol table layouts but does
  not re-group globals turned into statics with local symbols.  It also does
  not operate on MH_DYLIB files.
- Fixed checksyms -r to not exit non-zero if there are no stabs.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-126 release):
- Changed strip -s <list> when processing an archive report errors in symbols
  not in <list> for each member but rather for the whole archive.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-125 release):
- Added -force_cpusubtype_ALL for libtool's -dynamic execution of ld(1).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-124 release):
- Added a temporary hack to checksyms(1) to not check MH_DYLINKER files.
- Added a temporary error message in segedit.c: "current limitation, can't
  process files with LC_DYSYMTAB load command".
- Added a temporary error message in libstuff to check_object() in checkout.c
  to print the error "current limitation, can't process files with LC_DYSYMTAB
  load command" so that strip(1), nmedit(1) and indr(l) for now print a
  reasonable message when such a file is used.
- Added -dynamic to libtool to allow building dynamic shared libraries.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-119 release):
- Picked up the changes for lipo with respect to the sparc target.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-118 release):
- Fixed a bug that crashed strip when doing a strip -S on a library and a member
  had no symbol table command.  The bug was in writeout.c in libstuff at line
  490 where it indirected thought the pointer to the symbol table command
  without checking if it was NULL.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-116 release):
- Fixed a bug in nmedit that cleared the N_EXT bit from N_INDR symbols which it
  shouldn't have.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-115 release):
- Fixed a bug in lipo(1) that did not preserve set uid, set gid and sticky text
  file premision bits (bug #40266).

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-109 release):
- Fixed a bug in strip(1) when multiple files were listed to strip it would
  fail with "can't create output file:****  (File exists)" where **** was blank
  or it cored dumped.  This was because the variable output_file was not
  correcly reset to NULL after it was free'ed.  The fix was to move the 
  free(output_file) into the else clause that also did the makestr() call and
  also set output_file to NULL after the free().  This is in strip.c in 
  strip_file() at the end of the routine.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-102 release):
- Integrated in the hppa support.
different misc/lipo.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37. Has hppa cpu stuff in it.
different misc/nm.c (integrated for cctools-102)
     Using cctoolshppa-37.  Only comment typo change.

Changes for the 3.3 release (the cctools-100 release):
- First major round of changes for the new shlib stuff.
  1) In nm support for .private_extern directive with -m to print
     "private external".
- Fixed a bug where strip with the -S and -x ignored -x (bug #36206)
- Added the "-o output" option to strip (bug #36252)

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-22 release):
- Changed file to print out architecture for Mach-O file that were not fat and
  changed lipo -i to print architectures on one line (bug #31882).
- Added printing for these  (bug #32553):
    { "any",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_MULTIPLE },
    { "little",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_LITTLE_ENDIAN },
    { "big",	CPU_TYPE_ANY,	  CPU_SUBTYPE_BIG_ENDIAN },

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-21 release):
- Changed in lipo when "-arch i386 a.out" was used by the compiler and a.out
  turns out to be an i486 subtype lipo treated this as a hard error. A safe
  fix to this was made to remove the cpusubtype compare in check_arch() which
  matches what it does for archives.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-20 release):
- Put back -O in the Makefile (previously was removed because of m88k builds -O 
  could't be used on lipo.c because of a bug, this is now a non-issue).
- Added cross bytesex support for segedit(1) (still no fat support).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-17 release):
- Change made to strip to only generate a warning message when it encounters a
  non-object file an not stop processing other files (bug #23144).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-16 release):
- Fixed a bug in libtool when stat_buf.st_gid is a negitive value it was casted
  to an unsigned int and sprintf()'ed with %o into a field that was expected to
  have only enough characters for a short (not a sign extended short).  The fix
  was to cast to a unsigned short (bug #30995).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-14 release):
- Removed the archive checking of subtype in check_archive() for lipo.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-13 release):
- Added the m98k (PowerPC) architecture (lipo only change).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-10 release):
- Changed the way the date is set on the output file when creating the output
  file with -c to only set the it to the oldest input date when an input file
  has an archive in it.
- Changed the handling of the cpusubtypes to support this design:
    The design allows each architecture family (m68k, m88k, i386) to have a
    cpusubtype that will run on all implementations of that architecture and
    have cpusubtypes that will run only on specific implementations of an
    architecture.  The design also gives the programmer the option to force the
    cpusubtype indicating all implementations (at build time with a flag) when
    using instructions that are implementation specific leaving it up to the
    program to runtime select the correct code to execute.
  The library creation tools (libtool and ranlib) operation in this design:
    When a library creation tool creates libraries objects of the same
    cputype and differing cpusubtypes it will create at most one library for
    each cputype and not a separate library in a fat file for each of the unique
    cputype and cpusubtype pairs.  The resulting cpusubtype for each library
    will be the _ALL cpusubtype for that cputype.  The goal is the library
    implementor should be strongly encouraged to create one library that
    chooses optimum code to run at run time rather than at link time.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-9 release):
- Added to lipo when the -info or -detailed_info is specified printing of
  architecture type for non-fat files (bug #29465).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-8 release):
- Changed the default for strip when no -arch flag is present to strip all
  archs (demanded by the NRW group).
- Removed ebadexec as the OS group has taken it over.
- Changed the checking in add_member() to only look at the cputype and not at
  both the cputype and cpusubtype (this will change as the correct handling of
  the cpusubtype is implemented).

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-6 release):
- Moved segedit(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and added error
  recognition for fat files and cross bytesex Mach-O files (and cleaned up
  -Wall warning messages).
- Moved ebadexec(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and added error
  recognition for fat files (and cleaned up -Wall warning messages).
- Moved atom(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and cleaned up -Wall
  warning messages.
- Moved ar(1) from misc3.0 directory to here (misc) and added error recognition 
  for fat files (and cleaned up -Wall warning messages).
- Added fat and cross bytesex support for file(1).
- Fixed a bug in strip(l) that did not round the size of the string table to
  a multiple of 4 bytes.  This caused the object file to have odd sizes in some
  cases and produce trashed archives.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-5 release):
- Created a new version of indr(l), strip(1) and nmedit(l) that handles fat
  files and cross byte sex.  The new strip(1) handles libraries and does not
  treat already stripped objects as errors.
- Fixed a bug in libtool/ranlib that caused it to create the library even when
  there were errors.  This is no longer done.  If there is an error then the
  library is not created (or the table of contents is not recreated).
- Fixed a bug that caused problems in ranlib when an archive with a that
  contained both fat objects with multiple archives and non-object files was
  given as input.  The "correct" thing to do in this case in not known (which
  architecture archive the non-object file is to reside in in the output).  So
  this case is flagged as an error.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-4 release):
- Changed the arch name of ix86 to i386 in lipo.c
- Fixed a bug in libtool that caused it to crash when sprintf() was used and
  placed it's trailing '\0' past the end of the buffer.

Changes for the 3.1 release (the cctools-3 release):
- Changed CPU_TYPE_I80x86 to CPU_TYPE_I386 in lipo.c

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -56 compiler release):
- Changed print_argstrings() in otool.c to handle a core files that have more
  than just one '\0' after the long 0 on the top of the stack (bug #19645).

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -52 compiler release):
- Added LC_PREPAGE.  Just the string "LC_PREPAGE" and the cmdsize printed in
  otool.
- Fixed a bug where libtool was not setting the S_IFREG bits in the toc_mode.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -53 compiler release):
- Changed STACK_ADDR to USRSTACK from <bsd/m68k/vmparam.h> .

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -51 compiler release):
- Changed otool to print the m88k thread flavors for te new thread_status.h.
- Changed otool when looping through archives so not to complain when getting
  a short read on an archive header when an archive was passed to 4 bytes and
  the extra 2 bytes of padding was read as an archive header.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -50 compiler release):
- Changed the instructions f[sd]sqrtx for operands FPm,FPn and FPm to f[sd]sqrt
  (without the trailing 'x').  This was just wrong (but the moto opcode is
  inconsistant with all others in this case).
- Added an nm(1) that knows about fat files.

Changes for the 3.0 release (the -49 compiler release):
- Changed where the 3.1 tools get installed, they now get installed in
  /usr/local/bin3.1 with there usual names (no 3.1 suffix).
- Fixed the printing of operands for the i860 to use external relocation
  entries correctly.
- Added the LC_FVMFILE to otool.
- Changed the Makefile to meet the RC api.
- Set this directory up for the 3.1 release (fat tools and 88k and ix86 tools).
