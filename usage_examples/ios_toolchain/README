PRE-REQUISITES:

See cctools/ld64 README + git + bash + a jailbroken iOS device

USAGE:

./build.sh /path/to/sdk.tar.* <target cpu>

Target CPU should be one of arm6, armv7, armv7s and arm64.

This will build an iOS toolchain prefixed with
arm-apple-darwin11-*

You can then use arm-apple-darwin11-clang / arm apple-darwin11-clang++
to build your applications.
